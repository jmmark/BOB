I want to start a new life
With my valuable hunting knife
She will shine like a new girl
And I want to shout out our love to the world (Hit it!)
Everything I think about, I think about
Everything I talk about, I talk about with you
But you don't know what I go through
You don't know
Days, they will turn into nights
But my valuable hunting knife
It will not rust through the tears
And it will not lose its appeal over years (Come on!)
Everything I think about, I think about
Everything I talk about, I talk about with you
But you don't know what I go through
You don't know
I'll never know
I'll never know
I'll never know
And then I will run
And then I will
And then I will hide
And then I will
And then I will run
And then I will
And then I will hide
I'll never know
I'll never know
I am a scientist - I seek to understand me
All of my impurities and evils yet unknown
I am a journalist - I write to you to show you
I am an incurable
And nothing else behaves like me
And I know what's right
But I'm losing sight
Of the clues for which I search and choose
To abuse
To just unlock my mind
Yeah, and just unlock my mind
I am a pharmacist
Prescriptions, I will fill you
Potions, pills and medicines
To ease your painful lives
I am a lost soul
I shoot myself with rock and roll
The hole I dig is bottomless
But nothing else can set me free
And I know what's right
But I'm losing sight
Of the clues for which I search and choose
To abuse
To just unlock my mind
Yeah, and just unlock my mind
I am a scientist - I seek to understand me
I am an incurable and nothing else behaves like me
Everything is right
Everything works out right
Everything fades from sight
Because that's alright with me
Cells are crazy in the head, evils buried in the land
For the king, for the dread
Animated freed, and cared
To be led
Violence, hatred in the rains
Kill the best and move the trains
Tax implies by the source of gains
Constant fantasy put in the lanes
No one explains
From the pain to the edge
Set the strokes from heaven's edge
From the wedge, reap the crowd of heaven's edge
If I waited for you
To signify the moves that I should make
I'd be on the take
Gold star for robot boy
Well then, that's okay
If I waited for you
To show me all the actions I should take
Would I get my break?
Gold star for robot boy
And it's one thing
And it's something to do
The robot boy, yeah
If I waited for lessons in true confessions
That could take all day
But I'm here to stay
Gold star for robot boy
Well then, that's my move
Well then, that's my move
Well then, that's my move
But it's one thing
Yeah, it's something to do
The robot boy, yeah
If I waited for you
To signify the moves that I should make
I'd be on the take
Gold star for robot boy
Well then, that's okay
Disarm the settlers
The new drunk drivers
Have hoisted the flag
We are with you in your anger
Proud brothers
Do not fret
The bus will get you there yet
To carry us to the lake
The club is open
Yeah, the club is open
Hey, the club is open
A-come on, come on, the club is open
C'mon, c'mon, the club is open
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, the club is open...
Watch me jumpstart as the old skin is peeled
See an opening and bust into the field
Hidden longings no longer concealed
Watch me bulldoze every bulldozer away
Each new obstacle from each old new day
Where it's going, it's hard for me to say
And shoot me down
And bring me down
But I won't be around
As you run through the places you love
I remember the faces that cry
And they're pulling me back so I have to die
And watch me jumpstart at the first light of day
Each new sensation just blows me away
Don't look now, don't look now, I'm a phase
Straight from ground zero, X marks the spot
I can't pretend to be something I'm not
'Cause I'm a supernova, erect and white hot
And shoot me down
And bring me down
But I won't be around
As you run from the places you love
I remember the faces that cry
And they're pulling me back so I have to die
And watch me jumpstart, I'm Maximum Jack
Shot through the cosmos like an alien attack
Film finished, fade into black
I can't terrorize, I see terror in your eyes
As we go up, we go down
I can't socialize, I'll be institutionalized
As we go up, we go down
And see the truth, yeah, is just a lie, oh
And see the truth, yeah, is just a lie, oh
I speak in monotone: "Leave my fucking life alone."
As we go up, we go down
As we go up, we go down (and see the truth, yeah)
As we go up, we go down (is just a lie)
As we go up, we go down (and see the truth, yeah)
As we go up, we go down (is just a lie)
As we go up, we go down (and see the truth, yeah)
As we go up, we go down (is just a lie)
As we go up, we go down (and see the truth, yeah)
Bitter fish in crude oil sea
You don't have to bother me
You just have to join in on this song
Crawling people on your knees
Don't take this so seriously
You just have to hum it all day long
To dine alone
To build a private zone
Or trigger a synapse
And free us from our traps
You won't see me turn my back
With my head against my stack
Spitting teeth and breaking open skin
Official ironmen you are free
Champions officially
But you won't catch me on an open chin
To dine alone
To build a private zone
Or trigger a synapse
And free us from our traps
Save your knock-out punches for the freaks
Happy little babies with red cheeks
You will rock them gently out of sync
Confirmations through the wire
Spitting gas into the fire
Am I also worthy of a drink?
To dine alone
To build a private zone
Or trigger a synapse
And free us from our traps
Strikes me as an animal
And now gone kissing
But soon be missing home
And waving at waterfalls
Too strong not to mention
With tempting extensions unknown
Oh, this time I really mean that
A cracking coat where I dig that
Oh, this time I want to keep it alone
Oh, this time I really trust you
But it can't belong to anyone
And I'd be so sad if I lost it
And the courage seekers
Of the aborted logos
Of declaration "no-go" are gone
But I'll keep a light for 'em
Hold down the fort for 'em
And wear my maroon blazer all the time
I am a tree - I show my age when I don't cry
I have the leaves that will fall off when wind blows by
Don't strip off my bark - I have been stripped of it before
Yesterday's gone and tomorrow has so much more in store
You are a bird - you're taking off in every way
Say the last word until there is nothing more to say
Don't interrupt - you know the squirrels are my friends
Get off my limb - for I will break before I bend
I'm planning to see
I'm planning to feel you all over me
So climb up my trunk and build on your nest
Come and get the sap out if me
I am a tree!
Fruitless and free!
No symmetry!
Touch me and see!
I am a tree - counting my rings will do no good
I won't live long but I would be with you if I could
When you take flight, remember me to one who lives there
Since you have flown, there's something special in the air
(Re-zoom/Busy signals from the home front)
I played the part
I played the start
I made a table out of clay
I placed my hands upon the plans
I waited for a proud display
I played around
I heard the sound of certain trouble on the way
I got bulldog skin
I took a car
I drove it far
I dug the quality of steel
I crashed my nerve
I made it swerve
I made it back - was no big deal
I tasted blood
A date with scud
And now I don't know how to feel
I got bulldog skin
(Spark from the master)
I am pressed, printed, stomped
And strategically removed
I am everybody
Insane without innocence
I am trapped, tricked, packaged
And shipped out
I am produced
I am produced
Pressed, printed, stomped, tripped
Trapped, tricked, packaged, shipped...
(The prisoner leaves limping)
Days into weeks
She rattled my mind
We stayed out all week
And got happy this time
She fills empty space
I kinda need it that way
Crybaby says bye to me
I can't imagine that all our troubles will go away
But I could catch her and break the falls
I could snatch her with breaks and claws
Today when every "fake it"
Decides to make it
They just can't take it away
Shove it, cus I'll just stay
Like an ugly unwanted stray
Don't care what you say
(Intermission)
(No more skinny cheeks
And distributors of poison)
Jane of the waking universe!
A wrinkled rose snapped back
And the flies on flowers spreading out
To all sickness of humanity
Listen to our queen as she is offering free samples
Of her lovely garden spoils
Jane of the waking universe
And undulating always like the tide
The devil's bride is calling all toward her skirt
And in the loving folds there we will hide inside
From any would be sneak attack
Until it's safe to journey back
Jane of the waking universe
(Repeat forever if necessary)
Someone tell me why I do the things
That I don't want to do
When you're around me, I'm somebody else
Someone tell me why I act like a fool
When things don't go my way
When you're around me, I'm somebody else
There is good reason I guess
Having at once gone too far
When you clean out the hive
Does it make you want to cry?
Are you still being followed
By the teenage FBI?
Someone tell me why
Someone tell me why
Someone tell me why I do the things
That I don't want to do
When you're around me, I'm somebody else
Someone tell me why I act like a fool
When things don't go my way
When you're around me, I'm somebody else
There is good reason I guess
Having at once gone too far
When you clean out the hive
Does it make you want to cry?
Are you still being followed
By the teenage FBI?
Someone tell me why
Someone tell me why
Someone tell me why I do the things
That I don't wanna do
When you're around me, I'm somebody else
Someone tell me why
Someone tell me why
Someone tell me why
Give me the cost of the albatross
And wear it around your neck for size
Don't let it get you down
I'm looking inside your house
And oh and it smells so nice
Your house always looks so nice
Maybe they're twice as high laughing
Maybe the time is right, you know
Promise me not to leave
I'm looking inside your brain
And Christ, it's a cluttered mess
I love you, I must confess
La la la la la...
How can I look through
Their senseless side?
As much as I'd like to
All is not right - and it shows
All around you
Under the tree - a seed
Come in closer
There is a sign
Shaped in the mind
Pick up
For God's sake
When we call you
Back to the lake
How can I tell you
All that is wrong
Nothing invites you
Can't get along - with you now
And I try to
There is a page
It's still unwritten
Why can't you find
Time in your schedule
To pick up...
Oh, pick up
For God's sake
When we call you
Back to the lake
Make no mistake
We will call you
Back to the lake
I met a non-dairy creamer
Explicitly laid out like a fruitcake
With a wet spot
Bigger than a great lake
Took me to the new church
And baptized me with salt
She told me, "liquor"
I am a new man
Hot freaks
This one is on the house
This one is better than ever
I walked into the house of miraculous recovery
And stood before King Everything
And he asked me to join him in the red wing
Took me to pie land
Said, "I'm a thigh man."
I will be eternally hateful
Hot freaks
Hot freaks
Hot freaks
This one is on the house
And this one is better than ever
And this one is on the house
This one is better than ever
This one is on the house
I've waited too long to have you
Hide in the back of me
I've cheated so long, I wonder
How you keep track of me
You could never be strong
You can only be free
And I never asked for the truth
But you owe that to me
I've entered the game of pricks
With knives in the back of me
Can't call you or on you no more
When they're attacking me
I'll climb up on the house
Weep to water the trees
And when you come calling me down
I'll put on my disease
You could never be strong
You can only be free
And I've never asked for the truth
But you owe that to me
And I've never asked for the truth
But you owe that to me
And I've never asked for the truth
But you owe that to me
I'm sitting on two heads
"Some seat" I heard some said
Just waiting for Sunday
Four days after Wednesday
The higher clouds are closing in
To hide the deeds of Fertile Jim
Could this be a brand new low
One that we can't talk about
One that we can't live without
One that we can join in now
I'm standing on two feet
Now buried in concrete
Just waiting for sundown
So as to be not found
The higher clouds are closing in
To hide the deeds of Fertile Jim
Could this be a brand new low
One that we can't talk about
One that we can't live without
One that we can join in now
Tower to the skies
An academy of lies
And what goes up surely must come down
And we felt the mighty blowout with the walls coming down
Or something like that
Most of us are quite pleased
With the same old song
And all of a sudden I'm relatively sane
With everything to lose and nothing to gain
Or something like that
Men of wisdom
And men of compromise
Men of weak flesh in an armored disguise
All fall down
"If it's right you can tell"
Echos Myron like a siren
With endurance like the liberty bell
And he tells you of the dreamers, but he's cracked up like the road
And he'd like to lift us up, but we're a very heavy load
And we're finally here
And shit yeah, it's cool
And shouldn't it be
Or something like that...
Gonna have alotta fun
Gonna hit a home run
In the littlest league possible
Gonna make a big splash
Don't have to talk trash
In the littlest league possible
The most rudimentary division
Of competition
Where no worlds collide
To be the biggest fish
In the smallest pond
On the littlest island
Where I shall reside
Or keep banging it out
In the Texas league
And meanwhile after too much
And also from running too fast
You'd run out of gas
But that's not possible
In the littlest league possible
I'm off to work again
There goes Mario Andretti
She's a real believer
In getting there first everytime
The first shall be the last
And the last shall be the first
Until next time
Were you unbelievable
In the mystic air?
Or was it just not in your cards?
It seems so unfair
So line 'em up and shine 'em up
And get them prepared for
The next generation
It's taken me hours
Days
Weeks
Months
Years
Lifetimes
It's cost me tears
Sweat
Blood
Sanity
Of daytimes
Of nightimes
A lifetime of nightimes
In the publisher's screaming house
I can't get it out
The last recording nearly killed me
Writers' bloc
Psycho all the time
It's taking me too long...
They don't have heads
But we can roll
X's and O's
As it grows
I brought this bunch
To fill the gap
Dust is rising
Ever wildly
Phases of youth
Permutations therein
Fervor to flex
Pray to your knees
We want you home with us
You could have gotten them all
In the planet score
They're like the ghosts of Motown
You just don't see them anymore
You only hear it in spirit
So make the most of go-town
And go down
To the planet score
And you've become Mr. Tune-Out
You just don't hear them anymore
They're like the spectres of L.A
Haunting the buildings of New York
You only need it to breed it
So make the best of downtown
Surround sound
To the planet score
In the summer that you came
There was something eating everyone
And the sunshine fund was low
We couldn't greet you
With a simple hello
And the watchers of the flood
Were busy in their chambers
Making sure there was new blood
To sustain their dying veins
But I believed you
No need for further questioning
I-I'm gonna leave with you
You can teach me all you know
Which way will we go now
On our trip to taller windows?
I really don't know now
I really don't know
In the winter that you left
There was business as usual
With the same old fears and frustrations
But the word got out
It was really such a pity
But the judges and the saints
And the textbook committee
Decided you should be left out
Not even mentioned
But I believed you
No need for further questioning
I-I'm gonna leave with you
You can teach me all you know
Which way will we go now
On our trip to taller windows?
I really don't know now
The lifeblood lighthouse flashing
Sixteen chicks remain on watch
For the wheels to come rolling in
And they do
Yes, they always do
I'd be bored and disappointed if they didn't
Buzzards and dreadful crows
Right on the tip of my nose
They wait like cats and fly out
For the light in my eyes to die out
And it does
Yes, it always does
I'd be shocked and removed if it didn't
Buzzards and dreadful crows
A necessary evil, I suppose
There's something in this deal for everyone
Did you really think that you were the only one?
Buzzards and dreadful crows
A necessary evil, I suppose
There's something in this deal for everyone
Did you really think that you were the only one?
You were the only one
Why is it every time I think about you
Something that you have said or implied makes me doubt you?
Then I look into your cynical eyes and I know it
As if it never meant anything to me
Parallel lines on a slow decline - tractor rape chain
Better yet, let's all get wet on the tractor rape chain
Speed up, slow down, go all around in the end
In the first place, it's probably just paranoia
But there's a ghost in my room and he says I better run
It's a thing I know - it's a thing I believe in
Won't you tell it to go away?
Parallel lines on a slow decline - tractor rape chain
Better yet, let's all get wet on the tractor rape chain
Speed up, slow down, go all around in the end
Speed up, slow down, go all around in the end
Speed up, slow down, go all around in the end
Cold hands touching my face
Don't hide - the snake can see you
Old friends you might not remember
Fading away from you
The goldheart mountaintop queen directory
The goldheart mountaintop queen directory
And we looked
And we passed
Through the hallway of shatterproof glass
She runs through the night as if nobody cares
She screams and she cries and ignores all the stares
She wants me to come, but I'm never going there
The goldheart mountaintop queen directory
The goldheart mountaintop queen directory
Sitting out on your house
Watching hardcore ufo's
Drawing pictures, playing solos 'til ten
Are you amplified to rock?
Are you hoping for a contact?
I'll be with you, without you, again
Turn and run, the angel's calling
You say when and I say I'm falling
Up and down through broken down buildings
Back and forth but please don't bother at all
Count the days that we have wasted from the start
Speak the words and build a playground in your head
Turn and run, the angel's calling
You say when and I say I'm falling
Up and down through broken down buildings
Back and forth but you know why I left you for so long
You know why I left you for so long
You know why I left you for so...
You know why I left you for so long
To see you sight unseen is worse
Then pick you up because you're first
And go where the whistle blows
And go where the captain knows
Is just a lie
To train the bear to not get up
Slay the beast and win the cup
And stay with the sweet flesh prize
A necklace of 50 eyes
Is yours to keep
You chose a giant step - caught your eye
Guaranteed sweetness that you thought broken
And you were not fine
And bearing in mind
Other ones that you could have wed
And hopefully dread
And I wouldn't dare to
Bring out this
Awful bliss
No, I wouldn't dare to
Bring out your
Awful bliss
So, I wouldn't dare to
Bring out this
Awful bliss
Mincer ray, don't worry
If the road's a little worn
It's a cold and filthy chasm
That we're traveling on
Richer days assured me
Of the weak-link mending plan
Danger's always there to follow
Just do the best you can
And a light shines down...
Mincer ray, don't worry
If the road's a little worn
It's a cold and filthy chasm
That we're traveling on
And a light shines down
And a light shines down...
I'm positive, Roy
That you're not the one
To look behind pillars of marble
A time to be killing and cold
I know that when we have to contend
I know you'll try to open your head
And then they'll start looking around your mind
And you won't be feeling so numb this time
In one grey wintertime
The ropes fall around you
A mountain of detail that I never talked about
Minor but nothing, no way
I'm positive, Roy
That you're not the one
To look behind pillars of marble
A time to be killing and cold
I know that when we have to contend
I know you'll try to open your head
And then they'll start looking around your mind
And you won't be feeling so numb this time
In one grey wintertime
The ropes fall around you
A mountain of detail that I never talked about
Minor but nothing, no way
In one grey winter
In one grey winter
(In one grey winter)
It keeps you from walking away with the crowd
(In one grey winter)
It keeps you from walking away with the crowd
(In one grey winter)
It keeps you from walking away with the crowd
(In one)
It keeps you from walking away with the crowd
It keeps you from walking away with the crowd
It keeps you from walking away with the crowd
It keeps you from walking away with the crowd
It keeps you from walking away with the crowd
Ladies and gentleman, back by popular demand
For your entertainment and spiritual enlightenment
Electric Jam Soul Aquarium
I'm dreaming it so it must be true
Nothing else could look as good as you do
And so we're a rocket goal
Up to where the astros flow into space
Don't hold me down
Atom eyes, don't worry your brain
Take a break from everyday
Sell the house, the car, the pain, atom eyes
I'm running away from your blues
Atom eyes with sprinklers are spraying perfume
Escape from the part of me
There's a million heartstrings ready to fly
Let's pull them now
Just be sure to live again
In the silver waters
We race each new morning
In the vegetable stream
Long live the dream
The mightiest toughman leads
Into the skeleton forest
On cold ass western wheels
The one of whom we speak:
A very hollow cheek
Send in striped white jets
In through stained glass ceilings, ah-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh
Color them white or red
Don't let anyone find out
Or expose your feelings, ah-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh
Cover your head instead
And penetrate this dark heart
And as the wound is healing, ah-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh
Crawl to the other side
Where things are new in brilliant blue
And striped white jets come speeding through, ah-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh
And we must not forget
The sudden pain of birth and greed
And what's expected of this superbreed
And those who dream to touch the sun
And those who run
Who always run
Perfect striped white jets
In their hangars, bleeding, ah-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh
Cover them all in black
Makes no sense to me
Proud men wear it only
Brings good company
How am I so lonely?
So run away
The sun is outside of a world at play
Awaiting the solid gold display
Mysterious engines run
To keep the dream from ending
The cloak obscures the gun
To keep what's worth defending
The best of days
The ones to remember are crumbling now
The vandals come for rummage
Affordable trends in anxiety
Especially the ones that make you raw
Portable men's society
Now I mention, now I mention these things
The best of days
The ones to remember are crumbling now
The vandals come for rummage
Affordable trends in anxiety
Especially the ones that make you raw
Portable men's society
Now I mention, now I mention these things
Affordable trends in anxiety
Especially the ones that make you raw
Portable men's society
Now I mention, now I mention these things
Affordable trends in anxiety
Especially the ones that make you raw
Portable men's society
Now I mention, now I mention these things
1, 2, 3, 4
His merchandise is sublime
But don't laugh at the Ha Ha man
While you were gawking I was talking
And squawking with the Ha Ha man
So now I think breakfast is the plan
Are you coming with the Ha Ha man?
Ha Ha man Ha Ha man ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
(It's a ridiculous concept, and everyone's laughing but me)
Full head of nothing
Fail to see the difference
Fail to feel the mercy
Off to join the flagstaff
Always crush me
Picture my amazement
When it doesn't always pain me
And I will reproduce faster
Commitment trailblazer
Your trail is quite a puzzle
And you are such a daredevil
And you are such a collector
Always crush me
Picture my amazement
When it doesn't always pain me
And I will reproduce faster
There's a kind of love
And it won't be long
But it comes from somebody else's song
There's a world outside with a different view
And it's obvious that it's just for you
There's a kind of love
But it won't take long for me
There's a kind of love
But it won't take long for me
Repeat verse 1
There's a kind of love
But it takes too long for me
There's a kind of love
But it takes too long for me
I'm a man of work and a man of life
Will I work to ??? someone else will buy
Does it ???
??? 'til I feel a wreck
There's a kind of love
But it takes too long for me...
Shot down from the rafters
And off to everafter
Consider this a failure
So be it, urchin's promise
The curse is working
The trail of bodies
That leaves no suspect
What did you expect?
And get it
Get it here
Get it now
The news is not worthy
Don't even look
Don't be cornered into thinking
Invited to the lynching
Specify instructions
I'll shoot the arrow straight up
I'll frame your ugly mugshot
Add insult to buckshot
And then I'll drink with glycerol frog-eye
Yeah, she can tell you every detail
Everybody hold your heads up high
Everybody could be touching the sky
Never never never never can go down (Never could go down)
So you slow down, and you walk away
She says good morning to you
And you look away
She asks you just what to do
You don't know what to say
But what does she know?
And what can be done for you, I'll tell you now
Where will you go
When nothing plays out for you?
Everybody hold your heads up high
Everybody could be touching the sky
Never never never never could go down (Never can go down)
So you slow down and up, up we go
Up, up we go now
Up, up we go now
I am the one
Who is the one
Who are the one
Who am the one
Etc
The color of my blade is red
Remember what you said
Perfection is killing the freaks yeah
Even as we speak yeah
Don't you ???
Now it was decided
??? the war
The silence will rise to a shout yeah
????
You told us we'd see it through
The practical joker police came
To knock down doors and to leave blame
I remember what you told them
The color of my blade is golden
They didn't come back anymore
You should've decided to lay it out on the floor
Be sure to instruct them to leave you
Cause they no longer would believe you
It's worthless to ??? you through
Don't you come back anymore
Will the new suits replace me
I'm so worried you'll never see my face again
Cuz I can't stand the thought of not being involved
In you current disgrace
And at the oddlot do they teach you to chase?
And back at the factory will they laugh in my face
When they read all about it
The lacking racking slacking cracking
Nagging bragging dragging etc...
(cough cough)
The para-coats are coming
When we open fire from the fear
We realize we're never really here
None of them any good
None of them any good
None of them any good
Re-crystalizing mansions were visual and real
But when they moved in for the pillage
There was no crystal village
None of them any good
None of them any good
None of them any good
Waits for a line
It was quite groovy
A miscue in the greatest movie
Doing my scenes
Of course you should
Not one of them was any good
None of them any good
None of them any good
None of them any good
None of them any good
None of them any good
None of them any good
Over the summer
Somehow awaiting
Sometimes craving
And i gave it all away
Let my mind slip away
Kept everyone away
I can't tell you anything
You don't already know
I can't tell you anything
You don't already know
I can't tell you anything
I am the minister, and the imposter
You said i'm on my own
But i am not alone
You are the militant
Fighting to bring me home
I can't tell you anything
You don't already know
I can't tell you anything
You don't already know
I can't tell you anything
I can't tell you anything
You don't already know...
Rose before sun
This one pushed his way into the chamber
Dogs barking, the sky flashing
Come one and all to the execution
Shell-shocked and mangled
Floating too flimsy
Dye string to sing this
The old pirate's coffee
Community fat birds
Loafing on big words
Molding on a lake
Pissing from a cake
Future is in eggs
The future is in eggs
Smiling without chewing
Choking out a grin
Spiffy kids in Cub Scout suits
Who crushed with marching army boots
The fearless leader on his back
Dead from a cocaine heart attack
You move me on to go
Extraordinary show
The movie of the year
Such realistic fear
Billy says something
Not what he does
It goes with practically nothing
But you and me
It is my human machine
Incredible mileage
Effective and clean
It keeps on smiling, smiling
Smiling, smiling
Smiling, smiling
Smiling, smiling
Smiling, smiling
Smiling, smiling
Smiling, smiling
All coalition, some nutrition
All coalition, some nutrition
All coalition, some nutrition
All coalition, some nutrition
I know I'm wasting time
Now and then I just want to run away
Please believe me, I don't mean what I say
'Cause you know that I can't stop anyway
You've gotta know one thing, babe
You've gotta listen to me
Just a little more room now
You've gotta set me free
Make up your mind, baby
Straight on the line, baby
You never really had to look through me
You really shouldn't be that way
When we touch with our tenderness
I don't want too much
Only happiness knows
I know I'm wasting time
Now and then I just want to run away
Please believe me, I don't mean what I say
'Cause you know that I can't stop anyway
Gotta know one thing, babe
You gotta listen to me
Just a little more room now
You gotta set me free
Make up your mind, baby
Straight on the line, baby
You never really had to look through me
You really shouldn't be that way
When we touch with our tenderness
I don't want too much
Only happiness threw away by the door
I can't stop anyway
I couldn't stop it anyway
I can't stop it anyway
I can't stop anyway
I can't stop anyway
I can't stop anyway
I can't stop anyway
I can't stop anyway
Evangeline Dandelion
She just goes to show the boss
That Alice thinks so
Pink soap and icy bullets
See what we face when switching our scopes
It's on in the war
A dress down a much humble finish
A lighthouse in confidence
One little lighthouse is she
Evangeline Dandelion
Her interview and hair appointment scheduled
Tune in rock star, there's no dark spot
Running around your face
You find time to get laid
You find ways to get paid
You don't see no busted rainclouds
Watering up your days
And so set in your ways
And so fixed in your gaze
You're calling out for more
You're breaking out in time
It sounds just like a war
And everybody's blind
You're digging out some more
And now it's time to fly
To sleep sound in the ghost town away
And you can just stay
A terrible way
Hanging out there, areas of gray
Got most of it motioned away
Got a life to lead oceans away
Tune in rock star, there's no dark spot
Running around your face
You find time to get laid
You find ways to get paid
You don't see no busted rainclouds
Watering up your days
And so set in your ways
And so fixed in your gaze
Corroded lime I chased
From my old window world
Seemingly like an ancient demon
Waking up and waved out
Class examples of an onioned diagram
I'm here to follow footfalls
Of a wasted plan
I've been waved out
And next there comes a positive post
The options aren't so good
Plus once the intervention begins
It's painful
Forgive me, I must go
I've been waved out
I've been waved out
Clouds open, dust and waves rise up to obscure
God's very blue sky
People skating ginger only endure
'Cause the very last of the sun died
Lines of shopping mothers grabbing the kids
Pushing up to the front
Rows of pretty little houses and lawns
'Cause I want you to have a beautiful one
Moving in circles out on the freeway, yeah
Coming and going to
Everyday (every way)
(Everyday, every way)
Moving in circles out on the freeway
Coming and going to, oh
Got a brand new car with hideaway lights
And a blue racing stripe
Cost a little extra but it's worth it to me
When money burns through the exhaust pipe
I'd like to take you for a quick spin sometime
To show you just what it's got
I can't believe you chose to work in the line
But I'm so glad that I'm not
Everyday, oh, it's every way, oh now
Everyday, oh, every way
It's everyday, oh, it's every way
Everyday, every way
Everyday...
Standing around
Hoping everything works out
Cause I want them all to work out
You were always so in love with the truth
Why did you change?
Why did you land?
Chorus: Look at the photograph
Nothing is real
Spend another lonely life
With nothing to feel
Was it something
In the stories everyone told you
You needn't heed them
Maybe you should read them
Go back to where you came from
Why did you land?
You couldn't stayed in flight forever
Chorus
Why did you land?
Repeat five times
Have you heard the story of Maxwell Jump?
Down at the station - the ass of a building
The reason I asked is 'cause you look like the chump
From the gasoline outpost that jumped up and killed them
Maxwell Jump is dead
As quickly as the August you arrived
Miles from everywhere and still survived
Some of the time quite lost
Find your spot
The mind that builds the soul must form a face
A character and ego out of place
Other times a target
On your mark
Seek not for to rehabilitate
Try hard to stop and not stop to concentrate
And nothing could be finer, yeah
In Asia Minor, yeah
The devil in the china, yeah
As slowly as the January snow
Miles from everywhere and you must know
The part that you hate and like
Hates to like
Be prepared for what's lurking outside
I am poised with silver bullets
But nothing could be finer, yeah
In Asia Minor, yeah
The devil in the china, yeah
Hey aardvark where's my ashtray
Put it in my room so I can smoke
Let's hire a race car driver
Drive through the park and just tell jokes
And if it costs too much
I'll foot the bill
Because I will
Oh oh I would like that
Oh oh I would like that
Rainbow Billy
Where you gonna go
When it's all over
And Rainbow Billy
I have no home
And it's all too slow
Oh you and me
Rainbow Billy
Where you gonna go?
???
On my knees baby
On my knees baby now
Rainbow, rainbow Billy
What you gonna do?
Volcano divers
Volcano divers
You got a lot to say
But hey don't say it
So much reported and
So much distorted
Divers
Volcano divers
Glow boy butlers fly
Climbing in the sky
Lights flashing
Eyes crashing
Glowing with delight
Take it to sugar pie
Oh they're studying
??Of the rudder??
Chorus: They want you
They want you everytime they see you
They want you
They want you everything they need you
Glow boy butlers sing
Odes to everything
Lovely lady you tiger baby
Glow boy butlers try
Crash low slowly die
Hold them duty
Plan their beauty
All right
Chorus x3
In my life I've seen people rushing painfully
Trying to be happy, but they're never happy
Pushing to clear a path, hurting without knowing
Like I do, like I do, like I do, like I do
Everybody wanting something
With no regard for anybody at all
Years go by and mistakes are repeated over
Until they're corrected, but they're never corrected
In my life I've seen people rushing painfully
Like I do, like I do, like I do, like I do
Everybody wanting something
With no regard for anybody at all
Came into town just to sing it out
Let the children play
Help them on their way
Save them
Took a turn with a temperature drop
Now I wanna go
Don't like driving in the snow
And when you call him
Will he be happy
I don't think so
Got a girl in trouble
Get him out on the double
Now when she close to be a good woman
Will you care to follow
Where next will you go?
Though your ??? will know
Sing it out
Taking it all in stride
But I'm surprised
???????????? pride
Unrecognised
And I adore, I adore the kissing life
May I sling for ??? chain
I feel your pain
Tactless black wall
A rattlers cage
When will you fall
It will escape
La la la la
How, you ask, will I know you
Especially when I can't see you in my sleep
And I'm afraid to be with you
Only when you are gone, this shall I weep:
Take my shape and then
Follow me, my childhod friend
Would I lie?
I would die
If you walked into my room
Someday cry
Someday smile
And say it's great to be alive
Should I stay?
Should I go?
Indecision is my mind
My heart cries
When you come to blackout island
Aim correctly
Middle of the middle
Center of the center
That's where you will enter
Like a bullet with your name on it
When you see the next investment
Aim correctly
It's a bullet investment
?? from bleeding heart
That's where you will enter
Like a target with your face on it
When you throw your own election
Aim correctly
I never ever hear you say
I remember when we used to love
You did me wrong, baby
I have you now
It's sabotage
You know it's the work I love
She tried to take me to her world
I don't know why you tell me now
If this is everything you loved
It's sabotage
Baby that's the worst kind of love
Well sabotage is a thing I've thought about
Your sabotage is a thing I want to know
I don't wanna see you
I just don't wanna see you baby
I have a lot of things to say
You don't want to tell me now
It's sabotage
I have a lot for you
It's sabotage
I gotta lot for you
You know what I'm talking about
You heard a lot of people talking about you baby
You heard a lot of people talking about you baby
Sabotage
Yeah that's sabotage
You told me lies baby
??? words are going round
It's happy when I'm up
You hurt me when I'm down
It's sabotage
We got a lot of words are going round
(Play that sad blues song good for me maestro)
(Blood curdling howl)
Ooh, sabotage, sabotage, sabotage, sabotage...
A broken leg drags in the left lane
His painkillers turn to sugar
So he finds the address in his coat
" this is wink "
This is the way first
We make life shiny - just don't move
And you will be a dissolving universe
Goodbye under the sea
You're perfect to me
Lock up the devil in a tree
Rimming an ashtray, face in the light
Local mix-up, someone fix up what we broke up
The pleasure seekers are out there tonight
Local mix-up, someone fix up what we broke up
You as a person have got to think fast
'Cause this is a party that's not gonna last
And this is the same place the fly got smashed
Dress him, dress him, dress him, dress him
Dress him, dress him, dress him like a queen
Dress him, dress him, dress him, dress him
Dress him, dress him, dress him like a queen
Rimming an ashtray, face in the light
Local mix-up, someone fix up what we broke up
The pleasure seekers are out there tonight
Local mix-up, someone fix up what we broke up
You as a person have got to think fast
'Cause this is a party that's not gonna last
And this is the same place the fly got smashed
Dress him, dress him, dress him, dress him
Dress him, dress him, dress him like a queen
Dress him, dress him, dress him, dress him
Dress him, dress him, dress him like a queen
In the early days he was bursting with confidence
I saw the light changing
Over the years he began to submerge
The nervous wreck we know him to be
The nervous twisted wreck
So watch out for Joker Bob
I wish he were just a distant relative
But he's razor close like Brylcreem gelatin
Icy cold acid in his heart
And with this we shall draw the electrifying conclusion
They strapped him in still chewing his bubblegum
Gave him the Jesus-shock
As the reporters watched
Finally his ticker stopped
They buried him with a smile on his puss
And that's the electrifying conclusion
Fall out of bed
They're issuing lives for redmen and their wives
Offering hands
And twiddling thumbs for dreams that never come
Often said
"You better not look away, you'll lose the day"
The way I see it, it's already lost
"So then be it," they say
They're sharpening knives
And primitive lives for redmen and their wives
Breadwinner and klutz
And losing it all before the one eye shuts
Well, I see it as paying the price
Nobody feels it these days
Well, I'd like to go and kiss them away
Well, I'd like to know another way
Did you notice that they're taking back lives
From redmen just to give them time to find the light
In all the things that bind with fright?
A killer's waking up this time
To rob us clean and leave us blind
They'll never see it shine
They'll never find the time
We'll never see it shine
We'll never find the time
Tonight the doubt will leave your eyes
And then you'll finally realise
That all along you knew
The dark skies are still blue
And when you turn the monitor on
You will understand why it's gone
It's always gone too soon
We'll supermarket the moon
And feed you with a spoon
So you won't leave too soon
The lifeblood lighthouse flashing
Sixteen chicks remain on watch
Sopor Joe you oughta know
How to move fast and how to move slow
Here come the fantasy creeps
They're all around you
They're here to give you the creeps
They've come to hound you
Back to Saturn X
We are having the times of our lives
We are having the times of your lives
All the way (oh, la la la)
To the walls (oh)
Anything for free
Anything for free
Off and onward
In the chance I took on a broken horse
Come the one who's no good
In your eyes
Anything for free
Anything for free
Decide now!
Decide now before you continue
The list is complete without your permission
I finally know how, I finally can't quit
And ancient ideas are on fire, my love
Completely, the rope has been severed
The night screams for contact and clue
I must keep a journal
I must boast a victory
And the hellfire is dying around you, my love
Around you, my love
Around you, my love
Around you, my love
Around you, my love
Around you, my love
Around you, my love
Around you, my love
Around you, my love
Around you, my love
Around you, my love
Around you, my love
Around you, my love
In this bitter world
Known only as a number
It was given
Blessed in its task
I transform into Superior Sector Janitor X
My coats are blue
And my visions are white
Aren't they?
It started in 7th grade when they held me back
They said I was way too small to offend attack
When I get my boots on baby
They'll see that I'm not so small
My little gold fills and chains(?) make me feel like I'm ten feet tall
I'm little Jimmy the giant
And then in the ???
They said I was way too small to defend attack
When I get my boots on etc
I walk around
I know the way
I make a sound
I'm ten feet tall
I'm ten feet tall
I'm ten feet tall
When I get my boots on etc
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves
On high seas you search of
The sickly sweet milk of selfish love
And knife these for warm fresh blood
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves
In studded crown, the thief of souls
The parasites - the bugs of gold
This fertile land, now spoiled and sold
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee, kicker of elves
He constructed a factory
Just because he was hungry
Just to see how it tasted
Bicycle wheel in a brat's brain
Chorus: Yeah he's mad
He's matter eater lad
Yeah he's mad
He's matter eater lad
First he started on furniture
Then he moved on to parking lots
Now he's eating Ansonia
Now he's eating Andromata
He's matter eater lad
Chorus x3
That girl sitting over there is defined as the world's finest Paramount Pyramid
I met this
Beekeeper seeks Ruth
That kind of timing just isn't happening
Not today, not on any day
The flying party is here
But the constellation is right
For a lovely fight
A special strategy for the warlocks to her
And his magical flute will sing you the truth
Beekeeper seeks Ruth
Flying party is here
Zookeeper keeps her
Beekeeper seeks Ruth
Zookeeper keeps her
Hello James, the sun loves you
Get your fear in gear
The flying party is here
Goodbye, I'm flying
To meet brother monkey
The timing just isn't happening, not today, not on any day
Beekeeper seeks Ruth
Zookeeper keeps her
Zookeeper, zookeeper, zookeeper
The flying party is here
Flying party is here
Oh-oh
Flying party is here
My ?? prevalent battle-shipped
In a world you think you understand
Stay put and tune to another plan(et?)
It's up to you to stay put
The shoe is on the other foot
Driven to the fields
Whipped like a slave
Ready for (out?)
Ready for the .beast unleashed
Large hearted boy
Dancing as their chance passed
Promoting national trust
And goose the tunnel for the ditch
Your jokes are ??swelling whining tracks??
It's a sign of the times
On Sudden Outburst Radio
Feed our egos getting our fill
With the Everything I Want pill
And Andy Paper it is time?
He's frozen up there on the slips
And so the minors collapse
They waste no time lacking guts
Throwing ashes on the fire
Cause everybody's a star
Manifesting hypocrites
In fifty blows, it's quite relaxing
You will not find
Most of the time
I'm not inclined to make you work for real
Don't say a word
Nothing is heard
Only emotions, let them speak through you
Real real real real
I really like
When you unwind
Sometimes unraveling into quite a mess
Falling apart
But from the heart
Temporary drifting out of reach but nonetheless
Real real real real
(Don't say a word, nothing is heard, only emotions let them speak through you)
Easy its not easy
Going through the
Chapters in my mind
Easy its not easy
Record level love
Shines on everything
Record level love
Shines on everything
And it makes you feel
The way you want to be
Picture me big time
Up along the range
With this woman of mine
Driving me insane
Parasites baby
Don't you know I can't lie to you?
There was a band from Beantown
They drove the now sound
With a girl at the top of her lungs now
Yeah, a girl at the top of her lungs
She'd tell the people, "Baby
The world will settle down for no one
I will deliver to you, yeah
I will deliver to you"
Picture me big time
Up along the range
With this woman of mine
Driving me insane
Parasites baby
Don't you know I can't lie to you?
There was a band from Beantown
They drove the now sound
With a girl at the top of her lungs now
Yeah, a girl at the top of her lungs
She'd tell the people, "Baby
The world will settle down for no one
I will deliver to you, yeah
I will deliver to you"
To one another in every place
Who speak like brothers and leave no trace
Of a world still divided by tongues now
Yeah, the world's still divided by tongues
You want to keep it closer now, don't you
But there are words that speak to everyone
Which I will deliver to you, yeah
I will deliver to you, yeah
I will deliver to you
The scenario is bright
For the king and Carol--
What we must tell her
And seasons are slow
So wait, we must
And hide from ourselves
Overrun by the rank
Roll over like an egg
And a man-child will kill them
And a quick procession follow
Oh, so now you know
We're all standing in line
For the king and Caroline
And the wisdom they will sell us
And the wisdom they will sell
Sell
Sell
Sell
Sell, oh, oh
Oh, oh
"Spy!" shouted the crew, "Let's string him up."
Wise off to the captain, now where's my coffee cup?
And it's been an adventurous day
The ship floats, but it won't float away
Let's just stay
Don your favorite costume, here we go
Belt a song from your lungs real long and slow
And you're doing a wonderful job
Shaping up with a competent mob
It's your job
It's as long as wide and just beginning
Been around for eons just like me
Grab your money and let's go for all the winnings
Cast your soul into the jagged sea
It's the number on your head
Now you're dead
Stuff you down the barrel of a cannon
Let you see the world as something to see
Take you to the corners of the playground
Let you watch the traffic through the trees
It's the number on your head
Now you're dead
And we'll run as the war trumpet blows
And the judge with the list of no-shows
It's not good
It seems bad
Just say no no never again
Stop lying, mind your manners
Out ???
Not good for the mechanism
When you ???
Please be careful
It's too hard on my heart
Just get completely out of my sight
Stop taking bad advice
It turns ???
Not good for the mechanism
Not good for the mechanism
When you ???
Follow the truck
When you ???
Follow the truck
Please be careful
Please be careful
Every street is dark and folding
Out mysteriously
Well that's the chance we take
To be
Always working, reaching out for
A hand that we can't see
Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me
Invitation to the last dance
Then it's time to leave
But that's the price we pay
When we deceive
One another, animal mother
She opens up for free
Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me
Look at the talkbox
In mute frustration
At the station
There hides the cowboy
Look at the talkbox
In mute frustration
At the station
There hides the cowboy
His campfire flickering
On the landscape
That nothing grows on
But time still goes on
Through each life of misery
Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me
Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me
Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me
Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me
She's got the face
She's got a face that makes me happy
I never thought about how
Lovely it was
Until one day she went
Over and out
Over and out
Over and out
When will she come back to me
Over and out
Repeat all
To remake the young flyer
Yes, we must define his high desire
Stand erect and not detect
The anythings that we could not admire
From a long line of highmen
Number one, is that the one to send?
To restore all the trial
This and then the national pride, so proud
A question to the lunatic
Does your day seem like nights?
Do your world go together?
Gallant men dash forth
He takes his place
He ends the laughter of the slaughter daughters
Takes his softness from his hand and goes
To remake the young flyer
Yes, we must define his high desire
At times I wish I were dead
Busy people dancing all over my head
Real shock value with every move they make
Real bad headache with every step they take
I get a contact buzz
Can't remember what the problem was
I find it hard to even care
Life was too real till you got there
My life is dirt, but you seem to make it cleaner
Reduced my felony to a misdemeanor
When I feel sick, you're an antibiotic
Organize my world when it was pointless and chaotic
I get a contact buzz
Can't remember what the problem was
I find it hard to even care
Life was too real until you got there
Hang Mr. Kite
From a broom in the room
Hang Mr. Kite
From a night in the light
Make him hang all night
Make him hang all night
He'll be flying high
Hang Mr. Kite
From a cloud he will cry
Thank Mr. Hips
For advice that he grips
Let us dance on those
Let us dance on those
We'll be flying high
We'll be flying high
In the evening
She calls for time
A beckoning
Upon each cozy corner
Talking ones ??a cocking hit??
Oh oh
In the morning
She crosses lines
??Of cocking pitch??
??A fatting?? moment
A child in chime
A locking hitch
Oh oh
If you chance to break your neck
Upon the slippery what the heck
Your older will stand in line
And break their necks all the time
Oh oh
And so take another drink
Everybody please stand back
And pray godspeed and dare to move
La la la lo lo lo
Oh oh
Gurgling, gurgling all the way home
Zoo Pie
All I ever wanted by you
Was to be a man
Get by
Every cop I beg I will stand
Come on baby do it
To me you can do it
I've already a plan
But zoo pie
All I ever wanted by you
Come on baby do it
To me you can do it
I know that you can
Say shit Midas
This world's looking funny to you
World's looking funny to you
Shit Midas
Everything you touch
Everything you touch
Is turning to as much
Is turning to as much
As such
As you would have it
Shit Midas
I don't know where I've come from
I don't know where I'm off to
I need to find a way out
He's here to help me find it
Exit flagger
Exit flagger
Exit flagger
Exit flagger
I'm not going to race you today
I need a life as same as
I don't believe in anything
I promise to leave you one of these days
I promise it'll be real soon
Exit flagger
Exit flagger
Exit flagger
Exit flagger
I'm not going to race you today
I promise to leave you
I promise to leave you
I promise to leave you
I promise to leave you
Foul and unchanged
Climbing the rope
Get in to the mood
Do you think there's still hope
Voted in no names
Prescribing the dope
A father that requires skin
A christian who trusts in his bookie
Zoos are the new truth
For the island-shopping rookie
Evolutionary big shots
Ergo space pig, he is the captain
And why don't you want to over and over
Speed up, slow down
Come in, come in the devil
Thought you were a ?bye?
And how did you get there
Radio waves, ?white blouse?
?Ships are launched?
(fuzzed out words)
In the midst of this effort
Courageous tongues are bitter
Don't blast them
Bring posters and broadcast
Not a public display
But a new secret
Come there to pretend
Bring your children
Allow them to watch to the end
Before most of us knew it
Contagious words have bitten
Don't use them
Don't post them for broadcast
Keep then private and away
Like an old weapon
Come here on command
Like good children
Allow us to watch 'til to the end
Cigarette lifter
The frozen violins
Solid movement
Privately
I got nothing left to go on
And that's a fact
Zero elasticity
Won't bounce back
This time it takes no doubt
A feeling everytime
A box of zeros
Hits you worse
I'll note the witness
Sly and cursed
I'll go second
You go first
In your motivational jumpsuit
And we won't bounce back
Maybe it's just physics
Enzymes and space
I got zero elasticity
In my face
But everything being fake
Appears to be changing shape
In more slow minutes
Speak your truth
From endless slipping
I feel bruised
You go freshly
I'll go used
It's an occupational hazzard
And we all know that
Image twisted jilted feeble
And however we become
Whomever
Grand marshals
And naval commanders
Enjoy our daughters of joy
And its the finer things in life
That allow us to stand up
For liberty
Only even without reaching
We walked along the water
We walked along the water
We walked along the water
We walked along the water
And stand down
We will tour the ground
For a while
We walked along the waters
(Calling that opera surprise)
Staring at all our waste and
Staring at all the corpsmen
We watched along the
I'll breathe
Introducing the amazing Rockethead
You know what the deal is, dude
Excuse me, Napoleon
But I gotta know
Why I gotta stand
In a hallway
In a highway
Where nothing goes my way
Well, I'm going out
Well, I'm going in
To the Big Chief's place
Gonna slap his factory down
Cheyenne - The face of pride never died
Cheyenne - The true blue water
Cheyenne - I celebrate for you and I
Sifting through the pieces of the broken prize
Cheyenne - I'm sending out satellites
Cheyenne - I'm hovering quite largely
Cheyenne - In paradox in suicide
Cheyenne in white
And if an innocent minute lives for the light
The time is right
Define a line
To hold back the night - inside
A single glimpse of purity
In a flickering light
Cheyenne sees right
And if an innocent minute lives for the light
The time is right, define a line
To hold back the night inside
A single glimpse of purity in a flickering light
Cheyenne sees right
Cheyenne - A drama not acted out
Cheyenne - In destiny stay gazing
Cheyenne - In witnessing if I'm to miss
Cheyenne in white
Cheyenne in white
Cheyenne in white
Cheyenne in white
Cheyenne in white
Cheyenne in white
Cheyenne in white
Cheyenne in white
It's time for a round
Some times I cry for the sane
The sane worth speaking of
Electric misery
Like lightning flashing about
In conversation
No need to call him out
Believe your intuition
How is it you want him to be
Vivid and psychic
Inventing new cliches
In you not happiness nor hope
These gifts do not matter now
The hurtful gifts we bring
Subject to prop and plan we have to nominate a signal we can understand
By now the naked entrants aren't who we need
Beneath the hollow tree in gratitude I'm waking up to cut my deal
In the summer that you came
There was something eating everyone
And the sunshine fund was low
We couldn't greet you
With a simple hello
And the watchers of the flood
Were busy in their chambers
Making sure there was new blood
To sustain their dying veins
But I believed you
No need for further questioning
I'm gonna leave with you
You can teach me all you know
Which way will we go now
On our trip to taller windows
I really don't know now
I really don't know
In the winter that you left
There was business as usual
With the same old fears and frustrations
But the word got out
It was really such a pity
But the judges and the saints
And the textbook committee
Decided you should be left out
Not even mentioned
But I believed you
No need for further questioning
I'm gonna leave with you
You can teach me all you know
Which way will we go now
On our trip to taller windows
I really don't know now
I really don't know
Meet me at the market
Where you bought me out
Closely examine
The contact point of the
Opposing rams
Now we are playing optical hopscotch
Now we are over here
Sketching the field of the spies
Front me a coroner's allotment
I'll not fail to return
An exact Earth pinprick
Now we are engaged in optical hopscotch
What's left of our vision?
Our swimming vision?
Of what division?
Look!
What have we here?
Where the fragmented mind is reassembled
A new gift for crying out loud
A small token of our appreciation
Human amusements at hourly rates
It all makes for trouble math
But when the lights come on
You leave me in stitches
You leave me in stitches
I hear you singing
The spiritual getaway
Yearning to hike away
From hurt and spiny things
Who use you for their practices
And settlements
Permanent holy wars dissolve and crash
On the red horizon
Busted bottle red sunshine
Moonfire flickering
Allow to flee
A mile to be
All the while in tribes I played
Survived and prayed to be free
And send my letters out
Delivered sermons through the sea
For the girls of wild strawberries
So proud to speak
Of how I otherwise am weak
And now I blind my head
Divine the current from the stream
A child I'll never know denied
Reminded who are we
By the girls of wild strawberries
I blind my head
Divine the current from the stream
A child I'll never know denied
Reminded who are we
By the girls of wild strawberries
Tricyclic looper breaks his neck
Brings the wall down, says it's cool
Tricyclic looper says come on
Try it but that's not my school
Tricyclic looper free the man
The man that earns a chain a day
Tricyclic looper it's a gas
Freedom now and have some class
Try his shoes feel the play
Try 'em with me, that's okay
Drive around all your way
Drive me
Try his shoes feel the play
Try 'em with me, that's okay
Drive me around your way
Drive me
Oh come on, loop
Loop
Tricyclic looper loves his job
Chose it that way, he's a slob
Tricyclic looper scream and shout
Take some drugs and ride it out
Tricyclic looper free the man
Free the chump who broke his hands
Tricyclic looper all the way
All the day in all decay
She don't nose around me
I'm okay with that
Does she break my bottle baby
I'm the one who said that
Tricyclic looper
Tricyclic looper, loop
Come on, loop
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah, loop
Loop
I am breathing, yet I see no sky
Things without wings have begun to fly
Unhitched trailers --- I see trailers trail
From the well, I pull an empty pail
Little man bleeding, little heart beating so
Evil speaker blow my circuits --- oh no
Brothers, sisters --- all transistors, you know
Father logic sometimes gets cosmic, you know
This song will hold you in its arms
This song will fill you with its charms
Wrap it around me every night
It's gonna love you with its light
Are you lonely in your life
Pick you up from all your strife, oh
I won't disown you in this hour
Not like a man who doesn't care
Dusty bushworms in your life
Crusty humans make you blind
Some of them grounded just can't fly
Come up and hit you in your eye, oh
Some of them grounded just can't fly
Come up and hit you in your eye, oh
Paralyze the chains
Soft the shelled remains
Stun the strike brigade
They are played
Out with cheek and hair
Take the right to bear
Teeth to bite them down
In the ground
My kind of soldier
You can ride on my shoulders
When you've won
Fight for the moment
Of control, when it opens
Then it's gone
Introduce your pride
To the other side
Vaporize the trial
With denial
My kind of soldier
You can ride on my shoulders
When you've won
Fight for the moment
Of control, when it opens
Then it's gone
I've waited too long to have you
Hide in the back of me
I've cheated so long I wonder
How you keep track of me
You could never be strong
You can only be free
And I never asked for the truth
But you owe that to me
I've entered the game of pricks
With knives in the back of me
Can't call you or on you no more
When they're attacking me
I'll climb up on the house
Weep to water the trees
And when you come calling me down
I'll put on my disease
You could never be strong
You can only be free
And I never asked for the truth
But you owe that to me
And I never asked for the truth
But you owe that to me
And I never asked for the truth
But you owe that to me
Should I offer you over?
Is it best not to pain?
We could ship out our shadow lives
So come lonely
Who knows when one of them should fall
You know without them I am small
Without them I'd go through withdrawal
I'd hear the talking through the wall
Without them I'm not brave at all
When I offer you over
Come lonely
Stifled man casino
In a bed of bland facts
Wake up for recovery
Stifled man casino
Unpleasant, co-missions, please
Turn it off, avalanche man
And down comes the roofer
Up go the stakes
In stifled man casino
No one gets the brakes
That's the breaks, baby
Stifled man casino
Scratching surfaces
Street lights blurring
Speech patterns blurred
Passed out on apartment complex lawns
Turn it off, avalanche man
And down comes the roofer
Up go the stakes
In stifled man casino
No one gets the brakes
That's the breaks, baby
Stifled man casino
You can feel all the dust in your window
You can feel all the lust in your mind
But you can't have what you want
You can play around and lay around
Your whole life
Turn it off, avalanche man
And down comes the roofer
Up go the stakes
In stifled man casino
No one gets the brakes
That's the breaks, baby
Dying to try this
Now I decline
Too busy sketching a sublime
Picture of you
Wisdom and truth
Cigarette in one hand
And a beer in the other
Dying to try this
Now I know
Dying to try this
Now I know
Dying to try this
But now I decline
Now I decline
Fine mussels & selected brains
The trimmings of slim victory
Over the smelly waters
Of "See a World and Eat it"
Shocked by a whaling umpire's trumpet
The starter gargles
The salt brine
The stoned nations rolling eyelids
The moments of gory league highlights
Swordfish swallower
Jumbo stats
Putting up big numbers on the ocean floor
To spit out our shit in
In hotels and houses everywhere
To drink, shave bump uglies
God knows what else
When i sink into despair
In desperate need of repair
Always be there
I'm dirty
It's crippling, never really knowing
They're huddling where it's always nice
And plus there is a flame of frail and trippy hearts
And swallowed, being small and being still
Following wherever you will
Look at them, they're sensitive
And they inch out, look at them
And plus there is a flame of frail and trippy hearts
And swallowed, being small and being still
Following wherever you will
(J. Pollard - guitar)

I have a positive hot gift
Want one?
A scoffer's clutch karma issue
Want one?
A nursery whip for men who skip
Want one?
Want one?
Want one?
Hey baby, do you want one?
Living the dream of kings before children
Come inside, I'll show you
A ticket to sugar pie
I want one
A lesson before you die
Hey, gimme one
I want one
Hey, gimme one
I drew up back when Mr. Skate came back from the attack
The official fag saw the cake tossed into the lake
And he crossed that lake with his overpaid army
Of rats and snakes on whiskey ships
And they are right, they were alive
They were fools, making rules
For their entrance into the butchery pools
Let them be and that's the lesson
An overworked dreamer and his cronies
On minitracks and motorbikes
And a contest featuring human beings
And other less sprouts
And other less sprouts
Straight to the lord of overstock
Who spoke for the millionth turn
"Don't be late for the superdeal, we'll save you a lot
And take every cent you earn"
Following tips, his overfed rats
Said, "Trust in the king of overstock
Invest in his wisdom and learn
There's less to go around if everyone counts
But if you've got the money to burn
Then you will be in
Always good faith
For what you are worth
In heaven on earth"
With surgical focus
She stared at me and said
"I'm willing to reach out into your head
And I will keep you and cleanse you"
She glared at me and wept
A change is not going to hurt you
Not this time
And I've been waiting in line for this
Now that it's taken forever, I insist
Until I get it, I can't breathe
Climbing high upon the rocky cliffs, she flies
With surgical focus
With surgical focus
With surgical focus
She stared at me and said
"I'm willing to reach out, get into your head
And I will keep you and cleanse you"
She glared at me and wept
A change is not going to hurt you
Not this time
And I've been waiting in line for this
Now that it's taken forever, I insist
Until I get it, I can't breathe
Climbing high upon the rocky cliffs, she flies
With surgical focus
With surgical focus
Well, I've been waiting in line for this
Now that it's taken forever, I insist
Until I get it, I can't breathe
Climbing high upon the rocky cliffs, she flies
With surgical focus
With surgical focus
With surgical focus
With surgical focus
With surgical focus
With surgical focus
Were you there?
Were you kicking?
Alive in aisle twelve
Gimmick of the century
In boxes and jars
And giveaway cars
He motioning for you
Twas a band
They were sickening
Arousing everyone
PS Dump Your Boyfriend
Promotional trash
Emotional bash
With helium balloons
So now tell me
How the hell did we miss it
Bared his ass for all to see
And no one got to kiss it
She goes off at night
Never in the day
To Jesus knows where
And seek vibrations
Been routine
In grand teacups
For she is the queen
Where has she been?
Step out from the shield
Hiding from the dreams
Where she has to bear
The realizations of never being
The moon splitting
With messages burned
What has she heard?
I have entered a shiny new realm
A very different and very spoiled world
It's with great pleasure I introduce myself
To call and thank you for such delicious pie
The irony is sweet, the bird is paralyzed
With one good finger you try me on for size
It's hard to imagine that you just want to leave
With yellow photos, pocket sized
Revealing mobility, your psychedelic eye
Spontaneous and violent but private to the mind
With nowhere left to go
Pass the word, the chicks are back
The chicks are back, yeah
The chicks are back
Pass the word, the chicks are back
The chicks are back, yeah
The chicks are back
The chandelier is spinning and shaking
The fireball is already waking
Revealing mobility, your psychedelic eye
Spontaneous and violent but private to the mind
With nowhere left to go
Pass the word, the chicks are back
The chicks are back, yeah
The chicks are back
Pass the word, the chicks are back
The chicks are back, yeah
The chicks are back
Pass the word, the chicks are back
The chicks are back, yeah
The chicks are back
Pass the word, the chicks are back
The chicks are back, yeah
The chicks are back
Pass the word, the chicks are back
The chicks are back, yeah
The chicks are back
Why is it every time I think about you
Something that you have said or implied makes
Me doubt you
Then I look into your cynical eyes and I know it
As if it never meant anything to me
Parallel lines on a slow decline - tractor rape chain
Better yet, let's all get wet on the tractor rape chain
Speed up, slow down, go all around in the end
In the first place it's probably just paranoia
But there's a ghost in my room
And he says I better run
It's a thing I know - it's a thing I believe in
Won't you tell it to go away?
Parallel lines on a slow decline - tractor rape chain
Better yet, let's all get wet on the tractor rape chain
Speed up, slow down, go all around in the end
Speed up, slow down, go all around in the end...
The colorful summer
I still remember
The smell of the chlorine
The diving hairline
It is divine, my child
And it only lasts a second
To study the plants
To hike the trails
Stray out from strange echoes
Collect the lights
Advice from the cows
It is divine...
To polish the pearl
To open the tomb
To piss on the hot street
Like transistor sunman
It is divine...
In a town
We were bored
Hi balls pound
We got stewed
But now we're sober
Calling up Washington
Calling up Washington
All I ever want to have is
She said no sir, just forget it
A time to figure out
Just what's goin' on
Chorus: But it's not a bad thing
But it's not a good thing
All my life I've wanted scissors
Not the kind that are so forgiving
Cigar box eraser bits
And that rusty tool
Chorus
Chorus
Chorus
Hey go
Quick, be off, be sinking
Lown down whale the navy wing
It clears out congested arenas
They sell rocking host balloons
And they're celebrating children
And the weeping circus
And the smoking-nosed robot
Tasted ???? blackens the sticks
Like clowns from a fire, the albatross winks
Faked to the back goes right wing shield
All in a day's work
We met at one of the Kinks' yeah
We could come from the inner circle
Of the dry ??
Until it is just one trap
One threaded ??
Old friend in your room
With your ticker
Feeling thicker
You get sicker, but

You think it's fixed
And yet you

We sent our uncle over there
Told him how to dress and comb his hair
Told him not to worry about the score
The challenge is much more
He drove the bargain very hard
Turned it up and kept it in the yard
Win the war but we don't care who for
The challenge is much more
They confirmed that he did very well
Excellent as far as they could tell
Patience holds the key to every door
The challenge is impossible, but harder to ignore
But we don't know who for
Give him hope
Give him progress
Give him time
Sell him communion
Dream angels telepathy
It's an item
Of appropriate backing
Regardless of enemies
Things are fine beneath your zodiac sign
The dancing monsters
Have all gone home to bed
To find their secret hideaways
If this is the reason
That I have no recall
Each man has his fuss
It's not a thing
You think you can run
But you know you must fall
Ever spiralling down
Afraid forever
It fazes me slightly
It dazes me nightly
But these things won't hurt me
And I feel like a completely different person
The white lines are tracers
For the facers of the aftermath
Positioned in the situation
Lost in battles of love
Not returning, still learning
Unborn, unhatched
Yet, but wait
It's time to collide, decide, if you will
A purpose for the marchers in orange
And still a circus for the children in disguise
Throwing bones to the drug-sniffing dogs
Protecting what we've come to know as ours
For the colors we wear in our dreams
For the flags we fly in our films
Well meet the maid, she's likable
A tonic for the masses
Rubbing her ferocious fur
Like rockets through molasses
Jump for joy, it's all the boy
The only one we need
Peaceful pet, he's all I get
So now you see how people are
Hey, look at me, I'm stabbing a star
Investigating innocence
About the shallow manhole
I get down methodically
Without regard to my soul
Raise my hand
And speak the truth
I'm starving for a fun fuck
I don't believe how people are
Look at me, I'm stabbing a star
Look at me, I'm stabbing a star
Look at me, I'm stabbing a star
Look at me, I'm stabbing a star
You told me you'd give your soul to the crowd
You run to the edge of the warzone
You're finding out that it's way too late
To be happy around your friends
You changed your head
And made your bed
Through time, circumstances and medicines
You lied a lot
Created a plot
To escort you safely away
Chorus: My impression now
My impression now
Stand on the edge of the ledge
Jump off cause nobody cares
You told me you found a way to escape
Through silence and not a suggestion
To apply it all to everyday life
But it can't find the connection
The magic lens
You contacted friends
Who just never seem to be with you
Flying up on a paper cup
They land to s-sailing away
Chorus
Chorus
Friend of mine, what did you find?
The fog of a nightmare dissipating
A rolling sign, better than mine
The ghosts of a different dream are waiting
A different kind of kiss
The souls of a different mist are rolling
I've been inside the mist
The ghosts of another fist are calling
The troops are led in tournament red
In spite of the ogre's trumpet blaring
A world of hate can't penetrate
The crest of a different shield you're wearing
A different kind of fight
And keep those telephones a-ringing
I've been inside all right
The ghosts of a different dream are singing
Fuck fuck fucking fuck
I'm going mobile
I'm on the road now
Now watch my feet move
Go go
I'm going mobile
I'm gonna move now
I'm on the go now
From room to room now
Go go
From street to street now
From town to town now
I kept at moving
I kept at moving
I'm going mobile
Go move move go
Move
I'm going mobile
I'm going mobile
Post-punk X-Man parked his fork-lift
Like a billion stars flickering from the grinder's wheel
Lower hybrid, clad in metal
In subgroup tools
Excused from schools
To fathom hell
See you now
Echo and his brother (Echo and his brother)
Fish and Peter the Pig
Will meet where it's big

Slow down to a cool crawl
Until your knees weak until your legs fall
Slow down to a cool crawl
Don't give your feet speed
Until the ??end calls??
Chorus: In the first place
Who could blame you
In the second place
You're insane
I get the feelin' that
You're just circling around
Slow down to a cool crawl
Until your beauty fades until your muscles fall
Slow down to a cool crawl
Until your breath goes until a hush falls
Chorus (replace "get" with "like")
Repeat first verse

Settlement down
X marks the spot
Who largest commodity is a brick home
And a big parking lot
At settlement down
Settlement down
A great place to start
With the safety in numbers but your hands gotta
Cover up your heart
At settlement down
Mess me up, scratch liquid
Field tested, dirty water
Fell asleep and found it boat
Cross my heart not to return
Watch it burn
Dirty water, all of it
Flag torn, half rations
Steel rusted dirty water
Found a tree and hitched me up
Brought me down to all I had done
Wouldn't float
Dirty water, some of it
Taken aside and lectured on how the people do not act
When forced and revealing hidden charms
The last text on village firearms
Loads of creamy music and lots of time to make it
Behind the steamy newsroom - they wouldn't dare to fake it
Lasting forever through radioactive weather
Do what you do - shake what it is
Add'em up - yeah! !158 years of beautiful sex
Dome rust at your top
I thought you were nice
I thought you were
I find your rust
I find your dome rust
I find your rust
I find your dome rust
I find your dome rust
On top you were
Come on, come dome rust
That's how we know, that's how we know our dome rust
That's how we know, that's how we know our dome rust
That's how we know, that's how we know our dome rust
Visit mysterious fields
See them with small courage
There you will come to a bird
She may scream the word
But if that's what you think you heard
Then what's what you heard
And if that's what you want to hear
Then that's what I will tell you
Black without warning
The storm and the morning star
It's look! We are angels on wires
From a pregnant sky
And if that's where you think you'll go
Then that's where you'll go
And if what's what you want to feel
Then that's what I will sell you
And now I've come back
Translucent and peeled
At Huffman Prairie Flying Field
I've come to start up my head
Been closed and locked up
For far too long
For far too long
For far too long
For far too long
Trailing off the likes of it
She likes it when it grows
Sending out a candidate
She's sinking her foes
Peaking out then leveling
Wherever it goes
And her mother will greet you
And a river will reach you
Breaking out to make you slave again
Chasing Heather crazy
Chasing Heather crazy
Making sure that all the world is coming down
All the world is coming down on her
Anywhere I want to
And if you want to come too
We'll go down where
All the girls are stumblin' round
All the world is crumbling down around her
Staring out from otherworldly windows painted red
Doesn't have to listen to the voices in your head
That's a different lie
Do you remember what was said?
And her mother will greet you
And a river will reach you
Breaking out to make you slave again
Chasing Heather crazy
Chasing Heather crazy
Making sure that all the world is coming down
All the world is coming down on her
Anywhere I want to
And if you want to come too
We'll go down where
All the girls are stumblin' round
All the world is crumbling down around her
Around her
Around her
Around her
Around her
I want to start a new life
With my valuable hunting knife
She will shine like a new girl
And I want to shout out our love to the world, hit it
Everything I think about I think about
Everything I talk about I talk about with you
But you don't know what I go through
You don't know
Days, they will turn into nights
But my valuable hunting knife
It will not rust through the tears
And it will not lose its appeal over years, come on
Everything I think about I think about
Everything I talk about I talk about with you
But you don't know what I go through
You don't know
I'll never know
I'll never know
And then I will run
And then I will. . 
And then I will hide
And then I will. . 
And then I will run
And then I will. . 
And then I will hide
I'll never know
I'll never know
Bring me closer to you
Closer to in your finite
Smaller in pink expression
Lurched in urchin promise
Sightless is pretty, finding the city
Know your disguise above the surprise
Tree-line flies and jet stream
Rich like royal custard
Close that I may taste it
Gross that I may waste it
Sightless is pretty, finding the city
Know your disguise above the surprise
Run to the village, mold to the city
Know your disguise
Amorphous
Surprise your eyes
Amorphous
Surprise your eyes
Amorphous
Surprise
And now we see eye to eye
That another man's trash is collectible
And every weakness is correctible
Be leaving here quite soon now
Be pushing off to the moon now
And my I have had quite a time
And the mosh pit is filled
With memrobilia yeah
And if you'd have stayed
They'd have killed ya
And taken you home anytime now
And I had a very nice time now
Chorus: We are not so cold, are we?
They are not so bold, are they?
And I am getting old, aren't I?
Repeat chorus
And how did you like my clothes?
I wore them so that they wouldn't ??dop?? us
Frostman says the summer needs to wait for you
Frostman says the wintertime is blue
Oh, frostman I'm with you
Even when the sun shines
Even when the winter comes
What of the blessings
Of the tired arms waiting for more?
At times and if you sleep
And the pressure is then off
Where has it gone?
What blazing white giant
Pulls off the darkness?
Is it good for you
To ask for assistance?
And to ask for it for others also?
Next time you get sick you'll know
You might even see
You might even see
You'll see
Popular coastline
Sniffing the gales
Popular shoreline
Driving the scales
Let him cry like a crocodile around you now
Thrashing about you
In for the kills
Treading the waters
Footing the spills
Let him cry like a crocodile around you now
Around you
Around you
Around you now
Around you now
Let him cry like a crocodile around you now
Farther than the yields
Are what you expected
And what you think you know
Is where you must go
Stronger than the games
Where nothing still remains but
Only what you steal
It's how you must feel
And you must run
From heel to toe
Pretend to go
Pretend to know
The paradox within you
The (camel threat loom)
The inchworm treadmill
And you will
The opposite continues
When the opposite continues
A ghostly he(?), that bringeth his imperfections
And boast of the work that we have not yet done
Many a mile, to freedoms unlimited
And that is this, and so forth, and right on
But by and large, Blood of the vine
Fruit of the womb, sweat of the brow
And nothing to show but destitution
For the rest of your days
You must dig a deeper hole
And then you'll feel better
So spies feel wise, with flies around the flies(?)
Motors to the checkpoint, not prepared for flight
Now a new discovery's been made
We'll cover up the cover ups and move on
You can fly anything right
When you're right, when you're wrong now
I know
You can fly anything right
When you're right, when you're wrong now
I know
If you want to, you'll reach the sun
And I'll respect you when you're number one
But if you say so and mean it, it's your song
You fly it wrong
You can do anything well
When you're right, when you're wrong now
I know
You can do anything well
When you're right, when you're wrong now
I know
And if you want to, you'll take the fall
And they'll still love you, you drop the ball
But if you think so and will it, it's your night
You do it right, you fly it right
Yeah, you know things could get much worse
You know things could get much worse
Could be better, yeah...
Her psychology today is to play the crying game
To elicit a response to determine every gain
And I'm wanting to attain something in this turnabout
When she speaks, the flag unfurls
And the heavens split in half
When she launches her attack
In her opening paragraph
And she is having the time of my life
And she is having - she is
Hey, you know things could get much better
Could be better
Hey, you know things could get much better
Could be better
Gotta be better, you know...
See it, feel it, buy it
The long and tired gazing
See it, feel it, buy it
All things are not the same
Somethings are big and
Somethings are small
Somethings are big and
Somethings are small
See it, feel it, try it
Your longing for some highway
See it, feel it, try it
A shame you lost your way
Somethings are big and
Somethings are small
Somethings are big and
Somethings are small
You brought me down. You ruined me. You and your family. You ruined me
I did not
You certainly did
Get ready for excitement and adventure
Let's go
The smell was overwhelming
For the carnivore
And packed in like wet cement
Frozen with fear
The message at the traffic circle
The colorful flyers all over town
The sun was shining bright
And the sun was outta sight
Let's move on
It was high noon amidst the masses
I felt like a bottom feeder
As slowly out of frustration
We began drinking
To forget about our jobs
Let's go, let's stay
Let's run away
The burning wings are saying things
The chemical air is in my hair
Let's go, let's stay
All fucking day
It's a storm
Understand me
They never will this
All we do, we do for you
Shit gets old and demanding
It never fails to amaze me
When I see it all before me
If I were a freak who self-destructs
A ride for boys in monster trucks
The painted sluts training monkey men
I call to the door but they won't let me in
And the human fly gets smashed again
He mixes his blood with tonic and gin
And I choke on the sheep stuck in the company of wolves
As you raise up on your hind hooves
Daylight breaks
I see a face that used to cry
Where were you then
Somewhere off to yourself
There's too many people involved in the game
I guess you should be leaving now
Get some fresh air in your lungs
You meet dragons with quick tongues
Kiss only the important ones
I hold you down
To a haven that you hate
Now I see it's getting late
Don't think you should have to wait
Nonetheless do not turn back
Refuse to hear another thing
You've always been a marionette
So go alone
Cut your own strings
Cut your own strings
Cut your own strings
Were you there?
Were you kicking?
Alive in aisle twelve
Gimmick of the century
In boxes and jars
And giveaway cars
He motioning for you
Twas a band
They were sickening
Arousing everyone
PS Dump Your Boyfriend
Promotional trash
Emotional bash
With helium balloons
So now tell me
How the hell did we miss it
Bared his ass for all to see
And no one got to kiss it
The Main Street wizards
How can you see them
And stand up to them?
And you make out all right
And do you better
To go and see them
Pretend to be them
It's true
Can you exchange the past
Nothing is made to last
Still they are coming back to you
Still they are coming back to you
The Main Street wizards
Tonight they're thinking
A formal winking
Across from afar
The mood is different
The lights are fading
The knight is waiting
For you
The most wonderful of tricks
Electricity in their picks
Still they are coming back to you
Still they are coming back to you
Can you explain the wrath
On everyone's holy path?
Still they are coming back to you
Still they are coming back to you
Still they are coming back to you
Still they are coming back to you
Come on, polluted eyeballs
Stop scouting out the field
Jump up, bright paper werewolves
And everybody everywhere
Anyone can scratch
And anyone can win
So bring out another batch
They want to get out of here
But they can't find the exit
They cling to the cinema
And they can't find security
Then they finally got recognized
So they left in obscurity and misery
When you motor away beyond the once-red lips
When you free yourself from the chance of a lifetime
You can be anyone they told you to
You can belittle every little voice that told you so
And then the time will come when you add up the numbers
And then the time will come when you motor away
Oh, why don't you just drive away?
When you motor away down the icy streets
You can't lie to yourself that it's the chance of a lifetime
You can be anyone they told you to
You can belittle every little voice that told you so
And the time will come when you add up the numbers
And then the time will come when you motor away
Oh, why don't you just drive away?
Come on
Speed on
Up where
Up where wah-wah
Wah
To be respected

The tavern's open again
The line-up who light up will surely decide the fate
Of these incorrigibles
Who plaster their messages up on the interstate
When she turns 50
I might be dead
But acting happy again
For singing his songs about rush-hour traffic jams
When the vodka kicks in
A night at the Rockies, digging in for the slam
When she turn 50
I'll bake the bread
I'll bake the bread
Good morning finger
Approximate a plan
To sell another t shirt
So how's your head hurt
And what's to understand
Of elevated teachers
You like a metal fan
On high at times
So go protruding hands
In aerospace arena
Interference dead
Let it go you don't need it anyhow
All at your finger tip selection-fly in all directions now!
Let it go you don't need it anyhow
All at your finger tip selection-fly in all directions now!
Come now Antoine, give me your hand
I will fly you across the land
You were nobody
Now you're somebody
We will search for the dream of the king
And friends will hate us
And you will lead us
And you can't change the plan when it's made
But we have changed it
Die for your freedom while you can
You can always use new blood
Sing me Lila negation cow
Fish will follow with eyes, man
Hand on my shoulders
March with true soldiers
And in fact, dear, the flesh is no more
Was burnt for our savior
Offensive behavior
And the last whale will swim to the shore
And the new land of danger
Die for your freedom while you can
You can always use new blood
Jumping around
Thinking about our daily lives
Here on the ground
Falling apart before our eyes
News is not news
Learn something old every day
Issues repressed
Mornings we fake our minds away
Oh, please don't misuse this information now
Oh, try not to swallow too much pain
It's only order
Rushing through time
Following footsteps out of here
Signals ahead
Better repay your debts this year
I guess I'll go
On with my sad and troubled ways
Hands on my hips
Questioning each and every face
Oh, please don't misuse this information now
Oh, try not to swallow too much pain
It's only order
Eveything is insane
The prices never change
The aisle of truth is zero and cold
The aisle of truth is zero and cold
Come to planet
Follow the search
Come to me especially
Drive me to drink
...in a car
Something tells me no
But i can slip through the bars
Under the bushes under the stars
Come to planet now
It's just a start
Come to me religiously
Rent me a room in your heart
Sometimes, I get the feeling
That you don't want me around
But just when you are waking
Just when the snakes are flaking
Sometimes, I get the feeling
That you don't want me around
Sometimes, I get the feeling
That you don't want me around
Here I go around the blame
Here I go with hand over flame
Down on the floor at nine o'clock
A scene not fully recognized
At precisely nine o'clock
Here I go with clapping hands
Here I go with "still no plans"
Illuminate the mystery
The film is not for view
The film is not for you
She's slender
Oh, she's cream
She's face
I took her from place to place
I moved her from room to room
I exploited her
Became the groom
So I write music for soundtracks now
I write music for soundtracks now
(That's what I wanted to do anyhow)
I took her from place to place
I took her from room to room
So I know, yeah...
Kleptos parading on market floors today
Insider raiding like boys who drink
And bring down everything
On top of us
This is what we're tired of
This is what we're tired of
And then much later
Paint it up for display
Maximum Torso
Cat from Pluto's purple moon
Said "Light me a can of gas"
This is what we're tired of
This is what we're tired of
This is what we're tired of (repeated)
Lingering heels
Clumsy with guilt
Shaking through crypts
Finding the feel
Of the room taking shape
Loveless chairs
Burned out lamps
Faking the pace
Wonderful place
And it's all taking shape
It's all taking shape in the room
Amanda Gray
She moved and swayed
And she danced across the water
Her hair had sparkled
She closed her eyes and drifted into day
Excess talkers told stories
A "Pioneer Chambers" release
For the gasoline drinkers recieved
And i failed to mention that
Even we could smell a rat
Woould rather throw parties than stones
Would rather break virgins than bones
Now this is just a theory
But i sincerely believe
That if you're into rock and roll
You've got to sell your soul
And now i've got a hunch
They've got something up their sleeves
And think that "Pioneer Chambers"
Doesn't wish us to leave
Doesn't wish us to leave
Always a choirboy
Edison's memos
The blueprints contrived of the Christian world
Do you remember the ways?
Edison's memos
Change it
Rearrange it
Oh, you've gotta change that attitude of yours
Well
Well - uh-huh
Well, well
She's a lady - she stands about 18,000 feet high
Almost touches an orange marmalade sky
Edison's memos
Edison's memos
Do you suppose that you could change your life?
If you could, then I wish you would
Cover your eyes
The light is too bright
Your wise men, they tell you lies
And what's worse
They curse
But still
I love the bite
Likes flies or maybe mothmen
As they're attracted to the light
They realize
The night has come to baptize
And they will finally realize
And what's worse
It hurts
But still
They love the bite
And I would like to die with you
I'd like to try but I'm not suicide
And I would like to kill you
But that would suit you fine, I realize
And I will not disgrace myself
By chasing you around to pull you back
And I will not give an inch
You win before the fight begins, but it's okay
I'm over you
I'm over you
I'm over you
I'm over you
Cover your eyes
The light is too bright
They should never take you away
Not with all the little lines you say
Especially when you make them laugh
Come with me, believe in what you're making me
Baby, out of sadness there is pain
But your barrage of little lines is making me
Change now
Change
Philosophers and critics of the play
We're listening hard to every word we say
Especially when it makes us laugh
Come with me, believe in what you're making me
Baby, out of sadness there is pain
But your barrage of little lines is making me
Change now
Change
Come with me, believe in what you're making me
Baby, out of sadness there is pain
But your barrage of little lines is making me
Change now
Change
Change now
Change
You bounce back
You're so bad
You know where you're going you know
You leave now
You come back
You know cause you know cause you know
Back
You know cause you know cause you know
Now you call me up
To tell me that you're lonely
I won't make things up
And tell you that they're only for you
'Cause that wouldn't make you feel any different about me
Without me
A message to the paper girl
Don't fall apart so easily
Don't cry too much, you'll get all wet
And that don't make much sense to me, you see
'Cause that would mend my heart and I won't feel blue
That's not true (that's not true)
I need more but it's not like me to fuss
With the problems of us
When it's likely to be in this state with me
But here I go again
And the paper girl's gonna blow away
And it's one game that I won't play
For you
For you and me
She can take me all the way
I got more to say
But I can't have you
Step into my world
But splendid Pearl I love you
I got one thing
She says two things
Maybe more things
Should be blue things
I love blue but yellow too
I like to win when
2nd moves to twin
And over and over again
Bands that swing with perfect girls
Yeah that's for me
Yeah nothing clean
Yeah that's for me
Cheyenne - The face of pride never died
Cheyenne - The true blue water
Cheyenne - I celebrate for you and I
Sifting through the pieces of the broken prize
Cheyenne - I'm sending out satellites
Cheyenne - I'm hovering quite largely
Cheyenne - In paradox in suicide
Cheyenne in white
And if an innocent minute lives for the light
The time is right
Define a line
To hold back the night - inside
A single glimpse of purity
In a flickering light
Cheyenne sees right
And if an innocent minute lives for the light
The time is right, define a line
To hold back the night inside
A single glimpse of purity in a flickering light
Cheyenne sees right
Cheyenne - A drama not acted out
Cheyenne - In destiny stay gazing
Cheyenne - In witnessing if I'm to miss
Cheyenne in white
Cheyenne in white
Cheyenne in white
Cheyenne in white
Cheyenne in white
Cheyenne in white
Cheyenne in white
Cheyenne in white
To seek the blood from precious stones is blasphemy
The perfect angels who monitor your intentions
God keeps his famous children - be respectable
Temptation creeps to you like rapists in the night
So smoke the rockets and float the boats
We'll man our stations like devil goats
And hope to hell we hear the bell
To let us now go home
Hangover child, what you got
You'll not require in any attire
Hangover child
Born into a lost desire, you'll know the fire that grows
Hangover child 'till the clock runs over
The check out lines for the red light sales
Bury your nose in the bookend sales, bury the scales
And you'll not back down, and you'll not fall out
Hangover child, save your breath
In the way that you're stare in to the face of despair
If you dare
Hangover child 'till the clock runs over
The check out lines for the red light sales
Bury your nose in the bookend sales, bury the scales
And you'll not back down, and you'll not fall out
Hangover child 'till the clock runs over
The check out lines for the red light sales
Bury your nose in the bookend sales, bury the scales
Hangover child 'till the clock runs over
The check out lines for the red light sales
Bury your nose in the bookend sales, bury the scales
Comes the sign of wasted times
I will wait no more
Ever trudging through the aimless
Forests we explore
In our boots and money chains
Misfitting cloaks we can't contain
Hidden hates of urgency
Declaring our emergency
And up the tallest window world
The distance was not clear
Unoccupied my brutish thoughts
We had no cause to fear
A lesson so severe
Hotter than the fire we built
Darker than the truth
Ignorance reflected in
The windows of our youth
Push me now beyond the bounds
Of healing hands and thorny crowns
And all the sadness it implies
I've tasted with my own two eyes
And as the cattle rack was cleared
The floor was brightly stained
And larger though we grew in size
Not a thing was gained
The fate as so ordained
Roll out the painkillers
We'll have a perfect wig-out
Sleepy boys don't look
It's not in the gazette
Or a statistical occurrence
It's octopus caveman
Drinking with the enemy
He's got a girl on every arm
He sits down and circulates
In the office of hearts
He's case-closed middleman
In the office of hearts
He'll steal you away
He sits down and circulates
Come feel the softest parts
In the office of hearts
Sit down and circulate
Come feel the softest parts
In the office of hearts
Sit down and circulate
Come feel the softest parts
In the office of hearts
Instrumental - i think they're instruments
At times I wish I were dead
Busy people dancing all over my head
Real shock value with every move they make
Real bad headache with every step they take
I get a contact buzz
Can't remember what the problem was
I find it hard to even care
Life was too real till you got there
My life is dirt, but you seem to make it cleaner
Reduced my felony to a misdemeanor
When I feel sick, you're an antibiotic
Organize my world when it was pointless and chaotic
I get a contact buzz
Can't remember what the problem was
I find it hard to even care
Life was too real until you got there
Fly into ashes a hole
They will polish you brightly wherever you go
Their ashes come true
They'll bring knowledge unto you wherever you know
Unofficial study guides will help you when you're ready boy
Superficial lacerations they won't hurt you
Exert you into growing out
Fly into ashes a hole
They will follow you into wherever you flow
To ashes so slow that the knowledge you acquire to help you
Ceilings now are clawing gold
They need something reverent and bold
Holding out for the heaven to unfold
Unofficial study guides will help you when you're ready boy
Superficial lacerations they won't hurt you
Exert you into growing out
Ceilings now are clawing gold
They need something reverent and bold
Holding out for the heaven to unfold
Grandfather Westinghouse
Always the hand in glove
Do you think you could rise above
Grandfather Westinghouse
His is the right to show
Do you think he could stop it or go
In the sun
In the sun
In the sun

Painting the mirror of sin
Kissing the saccharine sweet
Next of kin
In the sun

She wants to love a ???
Early ???
??? memories delayed
She can take you down the way
She can run you down the way
She can hold you down
She can hold you down
Repeat verse
She can make you down the way
But I'm hoping she won't stay
And she'll hold you just to touch you
And I told her not to trust you
And she's flying high
And she's breathing the eye (?)
'Cuz she's a rolling devil
She's a rolling devil
And she's rolling ??? away
Cold, sweat
I lie, ingest
Breathe in deeply
I lie completely still
It's not the things you said
It's not the things you did
It's not the way you moved
So learn
So learn
Play the face
Carve the names
See nothing better
Than service at your door
An argument awaits
I'm in my best shirt
Award the saint
Per shorty's suggestion
You ask for a current
And see it distorted
A very different concern
For non-stop handling
Bulletin borders
The doctors orders
You're not really there
A mannequin stare
And will they decide to accept your lousy credit?
Origin normal
And not so formal
And that's what you are
The skin that you have
Flown in your holes
Went shocking the ocean
It's out of my office
But I'll take rock and roll everytime...
Woke up one morning
Saw a rooster struttin' by my house
Sixpack rings 'round his neck
Cock o' the block
Don't stop now
Don't stop now
What keeps Big Daddy happy?
What makes the buzzard buzz?
A leaky quart of motor oil
Head for the hills
Don't stop now
Don't stop now
We pulled into Economy Island
King Shit and the Golden Boys
Plenty more where we come from
Top o' the line
Don't stop now
Don't stop now
Don't stop now
Don't stop now
Don't stop now
Don't stop now
Don't stop now
With surgical focus
She stared at me and said
"I'm willing to reach out into your head
And I will keep you and cleanse you"
She glared at me and wept
A change is not going to hurt you
Not this time
And I've been waiting in line for this
Now that it's taken forever, I insist
Until I get it, I can't breathe
Climbing high upon the rocky cliffs, she flies
With surgical focus
With surgical focus
With surgical focus
She stared at me and said
"I'm willing to reach out, get into your head
And I will keep you and cleanse you"
She glared at me and wept
A change is not going to hurt you
Not this time
And I've been waiting in line for this
Now that it's taken forever, I insist
Until I get it, I can't breathe
Climbing high upon the rocky cliffs, she flies
With surgical focus
With surgical focus
Well, I've been waiting in line for this
Now that it's taken forever, I insist
Until I get it, I can't breathe
Climbing high upon the rocky cliffs, she flies
With surgical focus
With surgical focus
With surgical focus
With surgical focus
With surgical focus
With surgical focus
I cannot overstress
But all heads are a mess
But all of its enormity and need for uniformity

Starts off her day with a Krispy Kreme doughnut
As sweet as life can get
Runs out to play with the promising uncles
Who promise her a pet
She likes the good-humour man
She likes his song
When everything goes right for her
When everything goes wrong
She turns around at the heart of the dropbeat
To let them all check out
Looks what she's found, when the gawkers and squawkers
Exchange their costumes
She loves the good-humour man
He says they don't call us that
She run like the wind through the street scene in hand
A doughnut to her snowman
Doughnut for a snowman
Doughnut for a snowman
Doughnut for a snowman
We saw the starfire
As it was landing
We're told to hold fire
Until unfriendly
Worlds are falling down like raindrops
Worlds are falling down like raindrops
We saw the starfire as it was leaving
We're told to hold fire
Until unfriendly
Worlds are falling down like raindrops
Worlds are falling down like raindrops
(We saw the starfire) Worlds are falling down like raindrops
(As it was landing)
(We saw the starfire) Worlds are falling down like raindrops
(As it was landing)
In the scalding creek
We were happy
Just to be happy oh yeah
In the morning dew
We were living
But now we're giving oh yeah
How are you today
How are you today
Yeah
In the freezing lake
We were thinking
About drinking oh yeah
In the morning dew
We were hoping
But now we're groping oh yeah
Chorus: Broadcastor house
I want to blow
All step back

Chorus x2
She lives in an airport, she gives little bottles to me
The frequent arrivals make my destination destiny
Constant service, makes one nervous
Go-getter, a real jet setter
She gets me back at a reasonable hour
Within good reason, within her hour
She lives in an airport, so I get to travel for free
And just like that bastard, the world is much smaller to me
Her special offer is quite the bargain, no stipulations or sales-pitch jargon
Her name is destiny, it's destiny calling
The ground is untouchable, the sky isn't falling
With her precision, directly proportionate
With my decision would not be unfortunate
For faster service all confidence in making
All good decisions and yours for the taking
This promotion, I know her devotion is real
Embraced with confidence, just like and salt-worthy deal
She makes it quicker, and competition thicker
Designed to spark up, a real weak ticker
No crossed finger discounts or false advertising
No money down, no run around, no crass patronizing...
Her competition, directly proportionate
With my decision would not be unfortunate
For faster service, and confidence in making
All good decisions and yours for the taking
Her competition, directly proportionate
With my decision would not be unfortunate
For faster service, and confidence in making
All good decisions and yours for the taking
It's unreal
You tell me what I'm feeling
Strong emotions
Bouncing off the ceiling
Show me how far you can go
As close as I can get
As much as I will know
Stretch the truth
And tell me I'm not dreaming
Trust your leaders
Supermen with lips of steel
Show me how far you can go
We've got to get real close, now
Let's go see the show
We are on our way
We believe what you say
Ladies and gentleman, back by popular demand

Got high on the hunt in camouflage green
A drop of precious oil in the orgone machine
Way-o
Way-o

Do you suppose she could change your life?
If she could then I wish she would
Do you suppose she could save my life?
If she could then I think she should
It's another busy day for the cut-out witch
Silver threads for her hands, need another stitch
Cold needles in her eyes, then we realize
It's another busy day for the cut-out witch
I wish she'd change this wrong into a right
Say pretty please and I think she might
Cause if she won't, then you'll fall, and bust
And turn to dust, so I think, she must
It's another busy day for the cut-out witch
Silver threads for her hands, need another stitch
Cold needles in her eyes, then we realize
It's another busy day for the cut-out witch
Do you think she can change your life?
Do you think she can change your life?
Do you think she can change your life?

Hey, little girl would you say that you know that
It's so hard to believe that it's so sad
And I know you're believing in something
But it's just so hard to believe in a nomad
I don't care what you do anymore
I don't care, I don't care
Hey little girl would you stop and just lay back
It's so hard to believe that you're so sad
And I know we just keep talking about it
In a swirl bunch of nothing turned inside out
I don't care what you do anymore
I don't care what you do anymore
I don't care what you do anymore
I don't care, I don't care
Hey little whirl I reach for you and you jump back
It's so hard to believe that you're so sad
I know that we've talked all around it
A little whirl we can do something about it
I don't care what you do anymore
I don't care what you do anymore
I don't care what you do anymore
I don't care, I don't care
It is my destiny
To dye it with her tears
Common ties selected
From loose threads in the blanket
Where'd you get the girl?
Across the mighty highway
Disappeared in her apartment
Never to return
Rise and fall
A chain to the moon
Breaker broke
All builders a bridge and a spoon
Rise and fall
A chain to the moon
Breaker broke
All builders a bridge and a spoon
All sadness of lovers
A chain to the moon
All sadness of lovers
A chain to the moon
A chain to the moon
A chain to the moon
My Europa
I want you there in my heart
You can see it
If you try
If you can
My Europa
I had you there from the start
You can feel it
In a word
In a world
In my heart
My Europa lives in a wink
12 minutes equals a wink
You will arrive in my heart in a wink
We will survive
I don't care what they may think
My lonely mile
Is charming from above
Do not run my love
No one is harming you
Why do you dream
Of strange men in aeroplanes
And parachutes torn
By wings of thorn?
Your lovely smile
Should not be touched
Do not sip this poison
No one is hunting
No fox and no horn
Why do you fear
What takes to the air
Before it is borne
On wings of thorn?
You can't go back and enroll now
I cannot root for you or sing along-hey!
You cannot pick another fight now
Because this is Tyson's favorite song
Tyson's High School
Better than my school it's alright
Tyson's High School
Kick it to my school in a fight
Tyson's High School
Better than my school in a crunch
Singing the fight song
Isn't the right song, let's do lunch
I'm sitting on two heads
"Some seat," I heard some said
Just waiting for Sunday
Four days after Wednesday
The higher clouds are closing in
To hide the deeds of Fertile Jim
Could this be a brand new low?
One that we can't talk about
One that we can't live without
One that we could join in now?
Standing on two feet
Now buried on concrete
Just waiting for sundown
So as to be not found
The higher clouds are closing in
To hide the deeds of Fertile Jim
Could this be a brand new low?
One that we can't talk about
One that we can't live without
One that we could join in now?
Pab Picasso's knuckle turn red, oh
Count the queso, liquid turn red, oh
I'm just, I never could be so long
Common rebels never compete o'er long
Time wasted, never once free, show it
Common rebels never can sleep, find it
Common rebels
I realize the record of lies in the rebels' eyes, the rebels
I don't know why I let you go out in the rebels pond, the rebels
I realize the record of lies in the rebels' eyes
I realize the record of lies in the rebels' eyes, the rebels
I don't know why I let you go out in the rebels pond, the rebels
I don't know why
I don't know why
Everywhere is miles from everywhere
No discernment distance A to Z
No directions to a cup of tea
Everywhere is miles from everywhere
There is fornication, no consent, nor king
Common thoughts make no common laws or sense in anything
In the liquid fire escape you sweat
Every dog comes closer even yet
I will bring you a rabbit you can bet
Everywhere is miles from everywhere
From the kicked up to the final gun
Daily until nowhere left to run
Everywhere is miles from everywhere
There is fornication, no consent, nor king
Common thoughts make no common laws or sense in anything
In the liquid fire escape you sweat
Every dog comes closer even yet
I will bring you a rabbit you can bet
For Chrissakes, Charlie
Send them your love
Pictures from happier times
When babies acted like babies
So did the grown-ups
The band played "We All Fall Down"
And some of us did
Fly off the wheel
Travel highwired
There are movements necessary
Then there is unnecessary motion
It happens all the time
You can see it swim
In the skin parade
In the skin parade
Where other objects move to
Right through you
To the other side
It is come alive
It is come alive
In the skin parade
In the parade of skin
Celebrating this level
Of concrete movements
Wicked
It's time to kiss the genius
It's time to break the spell
There's a one out of three chance
There's a pleasure banging my bell
I'm in the soft pink luxury tunnel
??? big time evil grip
There's a clown crazed ???
Sugar I got the whip
I've got a pocket full of friggin' loose change
I've got a stick shift booby trap
I wanna push it too far
I wanna re-route your map
Fantastic moments of grandeur
Ironic seasons of crust
I'm with the disco police
You're getting back on the bus...
I've waited too long to have you
Hide in the back of me
I've cheated so long I wonder
How you keep track of me
You could never be strong
You can only be free
And I never asked for the truth
But you owe that to me
I've entered the game of pricks
With knives in the back of me
Can't call you or on you no more
When they're attacking me
I'll climb up on the house
Weep to water the trees
And when you come calling me down
I'll put on my disease
You could never be strong
You can only be free
And I never asked for the truth
But you owe that to me
And I never asked for the truth
But you owe that to me
And I never asked for the truth
But you owe that to me
Chicken blows
I suppose we could have a girl or a boy
And I see what you mean
I'm not here to drink all the beer
In the fridge (oh, la la la)
In the room (oh)
In the house
In the place (oh, la la la)
That we both (oh)
So love
Can you sink to the depths?
I don't know
I don't even care
And our lives slip away
In the end, we will probably reach
All the way (oh, la la la)
To the walls (oh)
Over there
Have you flown? (oh, la la la)
Our courage (oh)
Is only a taste
And I'll get paid (ooh, ooh)
If you'll get laid (ooh, ooh)
It's our parade (ooh, ooh)
Driving northwards
Well-mapped cautious
All that we knew and ???
All night parties
Drinks and deliveries
Suddenly vanished
No more the explorer
Consider this
There was a dark side
Perhaps the real self
Never emerged
Gouge changed that (?)
All those powerful lines
Swim in a bottle
Now let's pay our last respects
It's a world of fun, don't lie to me
I'm thinking it's all open
For a chance to break your heart
And it's a world of fun for you
It's a world of fun for you
Come on now
To the world of fun now
For you
I can see you though
Lift me up and go
No concerns to grow
No returns to show
That you got to care a lot to know
Feel at what you stare
You can always be there
Go and please take care
Well with what you wear
It may look funny but it matched your eyes and hair
Be what you are
The impeccable
The untrackable star
I'll shine my flashlight to where you are
I can move away
But I can never not say
That I should like to stay
You say move away
I can't make you out to feel that way
Be what you are
Be impeccable
The untrackable star
I'll shine my flashlight to where you are
Be what you are
Be impeccable
The untrackable star
I'll shine my flashlight to where you are
Wear what you've grown
Well with what
You've always known
Have you heard the news? Sadness is to end
And I shit you not, I'm going to say it again
Sadness is gonna end end right before your eyes
It's a thing I want to know
It's a good thing, let it go
Water will taste like wine
Have you heard the news? No more f**king blues!
Comes the sign of wasted times
I will wait no more
Ever trudging through the aimless
Forests we explore
In our boots and money chains
Misfitting cloaks we can't contain
Hidden hates of urgency
Declaring our emergency
And up the tallest window world
The distance was not clear
Unoccupied my brutish thoughts
We had no cause to fear
A lesson so severe
Hotter than the fire we built
Darker than the truth
Ignorance reflected in
The windows of our youth
Push me now beyond the bounds
Of healing hands and thorny crowns
And all the sadness it implies
I've tasted with my own two eyes
And as the cattle rack was cleared
The floor was brightly stained
And larger though we grew in size
Not a thing was gained
The fate as so ordained
Recreate no perfect score
Imagine the table where I'm waiting
When I go out there
Just say the word
The one you envision
The one I have heard
The vines and the fiery baboons
Are they not free from the trees?
When I go out there
Just say the word
The one you envision
The one I have heard
The breathing at pace
With running time
The running distance
The peeling sign
Change has got to come and I'll be the first to admit it
When pushing comes to shoving, I'll be the first one to get it
Don't you understand anything?
You won't like it at all
When the fire that burns in the predator's eyes
Takes another disguise with a different face
And it all gets down to the people in our town
They don't wanna be found in the other place
Who am I to argue the words of our prominent leaders?
A little boy stepping in front of his mom when his dad starts to beat her
Don't you understand anything?
You won't like it at all
When the fire that burns in the predator's eyes
Takes another disguise with a different face
And it all gets down to the people in our town
They don't wanna be found in the other place
Changing is an awful task with the rules laid out for you
But things are different now
And a new world is dying to push through
Change has got to come and I'll be the first to admit it
When pushing comes to shoving, I'll be the first one to get it
Don't you understand anything?
You won't like it at all
When the fire that burns in the predator's eyes
Takes another disguise with a different face
And it all gets down to the people in our town
They don't wanna be found in the other place
And it all gets down to the people in our town
They don't wanna be found in the other place
14 cheerleader coldfront
Point your nose beyond
Creeping boys in alleys
Find them when you're gone
Stick close to locker rooms
And wavy clothes to wear
You will hold them dear
To something queer and stare
16 used companions
Have nowhere to stay
Give them access to parking spaces
No coin meters there
Stick close to locker rooms
And wavy clothes to wear
You will hold them dear
To something queer and stare
You will hold them dear
To something queer and stare
Dream fingers flipping
The me-first machine
All is done and won
For the war
Is in session
The test is a burst
Of your first person cursed
But it's never the worst
Cause it always gets a little better
When you open the letter
Makes you wanna fly baby
Fly baby and me
A bold night for my new rock shirt
Expected a burn-hole
Expected the worst
Such shots in the dark I should not risk
I command you to speak to me
And be humble to our works
We have suffered the changes again
And guess what they've been spreading
But we're not forgetting
Pull up and lighten yr load
Make use of the bold proposition
Make use the vast fashions
The passion is soon to burn out
Make us of the boring young heroes
Their efforts not wasted
Reward them for what they turn out
Of this we are proud
In spurs of majestical will power
Impractical thinkers design the dream
These beast-like invincible machines
100 jags in the road
Do you casually second the exit?
Are you into the easy way out?
A simple gut reaction is not to be found here
So don't come around here
Have a look...
It's a Freeway
Though obviously not enchanted
By the people themselves
I so enjoy painting
They are of course outrageously cartoonish
In all aspects because
They are exaggerated dirt
Usually precludes
Any detailed background
There are no room left for...
I have however done several sets
Um O My!
Larger than life
I left my wife "old fat Triksey"
She is so fat it takes seven men
To help her
Well no not really
But you didn't quite imagine him
As a bored little drone of a man
In a dirty T-shirt either
Today in a world nearly devoid
Of such things as sideshows
We casually except
Most of the television
Television! Ya
In our hearts
And our washers
That never need
Callus his heel and long ago
A chance for you to soul train low
The poets of ears the fleshy goat
Can lurch souls within the snow a steel coat
A melting snail
The kind of thing
That he once knew but
I don't see you
The way you see me
And I don't leave you
The way you try me
I leave it up to time
And will you buy mine
The last in line
The asian bottle in the drawer
The asian bottle in the drawer
The qualifying
The qualifying
The qualifying
Oh, the qualifying
Oh, oh, oh, oh
We flew higher than at first we imagined
We came over for a spin of the globe
Spat in rivers while the fish eggs were hatching
Danced with angels to the pulse of the strobe
Come visit our world
See what goes down
Explore new horizons
And fall to the ground
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How do you feel?
Chartered buses on an old abandoned highway
Taking kids to get a glimpse of the ghost
Broken bottles at the top of the stairway
Turn into monuments to those we love most
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How do you feel?
How do you feel?
You told me you'd give your soul to the crowd
You run to the edge of the warzone
You're finding out that it's way too late
To be happy around your friends
You changed your head
And made your bed
Through time, circumstances and medicines
You lied a lot
Created a plot
To escort you safely away
Chorus: My impression now
My impression now
Stand on the edge of the ledge
Jump off cause nobody cares
You told me you found a way to escape
Through silence and not a suggestion
To apply it all to everyday life
But it can't find the connection
The magic lens
You contacted friends
Who just never seem to be with you
Flying up on a paper cup
They land to s-sailing away
Chorus
Chorus
She was the happiest girl I'd ever seen
Starboy
Oh, Starboy
Oh, Starboy
Oh, Starboy
Oh, Starboy
Oh, Starboy
You know it's so easy to fall apart
It's so easy to fall apart
Wooh
I get mad at this world
Sit up and scream about it
Every dog has its day
And now they dream about it
He said love is the one thing
We needed in this world to be happy
He said love is the one thing
We needed in this world to be happy
Got a mouth full of teeth
Got to end this searchin'
I got down on my dirty knees
For a tax reduction
He said love is the one thing
We needed in this world to be happy
He said love is the one thing
We needed in this world to be happy
He said love is the one thing
We needed in this world to be happy, to be really happy
He said love is the one thing
We needed in this world to be happy, to be happy
Well, he said love is the one thing
We needed in this world to be happy, to be happy
Happy
Needed in the world to be happy, oh happy
Oh, happy
He said love, he said happy
He said happy, hey
I heard you what the problem is
I didn't hear you both
You're coming through
Like weird electric jive
Bumming your role
I'm playing your role
Will you love me come Saturday?
Yeah I know it's too hard to plan it
And will the attachment stay attached?
Until destroyed by a match
Watch it burn a light in the night
Watch it burn a light in the night
Fire cleanses a soul
Fire cleanses a spirit
But I don't wanna hear it
Through a box with wires
I wanna taste it with my own two eyes
Burn baby burn
Burn baby burn baby burn baby burn
Exhausted from the last escape
Leaving and returning now routinely
And are we changing to the taste
Of the haste makers?
How convincingly?
I cannot change the future
But I'll find you if you're gone
A second spurt of growth will come about me
Don't doubt me
And entities that hide behind
Images you love but are no longer
Their desire to keep you down
Make you weak and fixed
But I'll be stronger
Gather these familiar shadows
I will take them on
A second spurt of growth will come about me
Don't doubt me
You can do the balloon
Escorted or thwarted by the loon
"Take to the sky!"
Said the Chinaman's monkey
And you climbed like Einstein
Through the fleshy folds of
History's underbelly
And your artwork was unusual
And your scientific programs phenomenal
Take to the sky
My, my inferior
My inferior ranking
Has been...
I see the coolest...
I choose that direction
Coded ancient decrees
Unlock the timers
And strike the chimers
In my sleep
Grab the coat, steel the fleece
From behind the curtain
It will most certain-
Ly bring peace
To those with countless numbers
No longer cold or hot, like
Things that I will keep
And hide them in my sleep
Dead even countless numbers
No longer cold or hot, like
Things that I will keep
And hide them in my sleep
Coded ancient, oh brightness
We shall see
Loaded up and at night when
We shall flee
Not to tread through the heavy life
Sink in the dream
On the right night
You'll find her waiting
Selling things for cheap
The things that I will keep
Is the ever with intent when she likens herself to a crow?
Will she crow and say bingo?
"I'm a believer" she tells me
But is she ever going to cry
When the directors bark from out there in the dark
Fly sister vibrate - you were automatically free
The moment you came to me
Is she ever coming back to me?
Is she ever coming back to me?
Say it loud and we shall see
Is she ever coming back to me?
Met a man of energy
Suppose it doesn't work
Lantern man
Find an inoperative halo
Tossed inside a field
In your crystal ball
Was he ostracized
Injured, or a castaway
In a playhouse
With hoops and hairpins?
Grow alone
Have to know your conjurer
A spinster kept checking
For a special clock remover
But now we're out of time
Secret star of heavenly bundles
Firmly confirmed yesterday
Send no more joy
No more light
No more danger
It will always come
It will always come
To wish for you to fall
To wish for you to burn
To wish for your return
(1, 2, 3, 4)
He's the long distance man (long distance man)
And he keeps on going 'cause it's not worth blowing
And he does what he can (does what he can)
'Cause it's not worth losing and there ain't no choosing
Any other world that you live in
Don't believe in second chance
Sell another dream, he won't take it
So don't fake it when you dance
He's the long distance man (long distance man)
And he keeps on going 'cause it's not worth blowing
And he does what he can (does what he can)
'Cause it's not worth losing and there ain't no choosing
Cover up your eyes in these bad times
For the sad time, passing years
Build another tower for your freedom
He don't need 'em, shed no tears
For the long distance man
For the long distance man
For the long distance
Looking quite a mess
Standing in a puddle of flesh
?Sticking out my clay?
Playing reindeer games
Looking down the alley
At laughing stock
Knocking down the walls
?Making up-scene clothes?
Off to skating
?Conversation toes in the neon toes?
High, ho
Backing into bed
Falling out of tune
Disconnecting ruins of the stars
Riding out the day
Falling out of touch
Looking very much the same
As every little human in the name of vain
Watching out
Riding out the names
To assassinate
As of late
What's that you're wearing?
It smells so good
You don't wanna know
What's that you're eating?
Could be misleading
You don't wanna know
But I wanna know
But I wanna know
But I wanna know
A cow could fly if it had wings
We use the bones and everything
What's that you're wearing?
It smells so good
You don't wanna know
But I wanna know
But I wanna know
But you don't wanna know
But I wanna know
It's too late now
She's got me dreaming
Without you there is no truth
According to me
Inside and around me
Tears got me drinking
Without you there is no scope
In the morning for me
One of these days in the night
Old enemies will come back to fight
And since you would then disagree
We will be skinned alive
When full-colored kings arrive
And teach them we will all we know
Bring popcorn for Geronimo
And dance with our freshly made friends
Ignoring the old ones
The boring and cold ones
And when the colossus crawls west
Jazz bastards will fall and confess
We all love you so and your rock
Is paradise plastic
It's cheap and fantastic
It's too late now

Ride the red bus
Ride it with us
Come and wash the sun come down
Wipe away your useless frown
When he rises sleek and dull
What he does our union bellboy
Nothing else will work
He makes the puzzles piece
Plus no surprises
No pulling on the leash
For hips and rises
Her upside whiter
His ups are down
His ups are down
The password found
The password found
And though he razes
Tomorrow's plans
He never prays for
The same demands
Through awful weather
Through cramping hands
Our union bellboy
To excess
To our promised strands
Got my flashlight, 2X4
Necessary precaution
Plants at the entrance
Flies at the exit
Way down deep in the darkest hole
Lost my way, lost my soul
You can dig my grave
In Mammoth Cave
I would of brought a sharp object, yeah
But they've taken mine all away
All away
I pretended I wasn't scared
Something fucking stinks in here
Like a sump pump in a sewer
What the hell was I thinking?
Way down deep in the darkest hole
Lost my way, lost my soul
You can dig my grave
You can dig me a hole
In the Mammoth Cave
Mammoth Cave
Oh, tropical robots
When you come of age you'll reach the sun
And when you go away you won't come back no more
Alabama policeman.. let them go on their way
Don't spoil their fun
Cause when they go away they won't go back no more
Turbo boy
Can be fine
Can make his wheels spin
And smash the car
Clutch comes down
??? goes in
Leave the keys in the ignition
Just ???
I feel like a long lost ??? on a highway to hell
Waiting for a convict waiting on a sign of a bell
Long words and big black birds
On a telephone wire
She said I'll look over there
There's a car on fire
Hey!
Ooh
Swooping energies, I love you
So shot me down again I want you now
Would you like to play another game?
Swooping energies (x2)
Give me one more chance now, baby (x3)
(Repeat verse)
Swooping energies (x2)
Give me one more chance now baby (x3)
Moving
Swooping
When you motor away beyond the once-red lips
When you free yourself from the chance of a lifetime
You can be anyone they told you to
You can belittle every little voice that told you so
And then the time will come when you add up the numbers
And then the time will come when you motor away
Oh, why don't you just drive away?
When you motor away down the icy streets
You can't lie to yourself that it's the chance of a lifetime
You can be anyone they told you to
You can belittle every little voice that told you so
And the time will come when you add up the numbers
And then the time will come when you motor away
Oh, why don't you just drive away?
Come on
Speed on
Over the flames
The plastic airplanes circled
And every ambulance harmonized
A glorious yellow smoke filled the eyes
Of the baby giants given astro-taffy
To keep them happy
While the war raged on
And the friendly army drove to beat the band
How did you escape
Your door was locked
The exit's blocked
Now I know
It's not so impossible
Now I know
We can't go back to where we were
We're back to where we'll be
Ooooh
Back to where we were
We'll be
Fly as the people are snoring
And maybe baby, maybe baby, you'll be free
Look to the trees while they're growing
And maybe baby, maybe baby, you'll see
Maybe baby
Maybe baby
Climb to the top of the ladder
And maybe baby, maybe baby, you'll know
Stay with the clouds when they scatter
And maybe baby, maybe baby
Maybe baby, maybe baby, you will see
This song will hold you in its arms
This song will fill you with its charms
Wrap it around me every night
It's gonna love you with its light
Are you lonely in your life
Pick you up from all your strife, oh
I won't disown you in this hour
Not like a man who doesn't care
Dusty bushworms in your life
Crusty humans make you blind
Some of them grounded just can't fly
Come up and hit you in your eye, oh
Some of them grounded just can't fly
Come up and hit you in your eye, oh
"Make It" comes alive
In my private glass tent, oh yeah
A portable mortuary
Going
Going
But not yet gone
'Cause when it does
It does, and then
The ancient practice
Of mourning the phantom
Do you really think he
Would choose to inhabit the pore
Where his container was planted?
Can't imagine that
You are a child reaching out brave and true
For big things in the next room, and I
Couldn't step into such open sky
Along the crest of uncertainty you loom
I'm learning to hunt for you
I'm learning to hunt for you
Say that you'll never run too far away
Even with all the answers out there
Where it's brighter, but no one will care
Half as much as I care about you
I'm learning to hunt for you
I'm learning to hunt for you
Come on over tonight
We'll put on some Cat Butt and do it up right
No need to get all caught up
In society's stipulations
You're a member of the freak generation
They're gonna burn, but you'll have duration
When the pendulum swings and cuts
When the big door swings open and shuts
Yeah, we'll be middle-aged children, but so what?
And I haven't changed so drastically
They can talk so sarcastically
They'll bust up, but we'll bust in
Get knocked down but up again
When the pendulum swings and cuts
When the big door swings open and shuts
Oh, we'll be swollen and infected, but so what?
When the pendulum swings and cuts
When the big door swings open and shuts
Yeah, we'll be middle-aged children, but so what?
Oh, we'll be swollen and infected, but so what?
Took a journey backwards to a revelation I cannot describe
And I must admit it was worthwhile
And it made you smile - it's that extra mile
When we drove home you slept all the way
Right through the explosion display
Another fine outing, pointing and shouting
"Look, it's baseball"
Radio show, radio show
Trust the wizard, here we go
Radio show, radio show
Trust the wizard, don't say no
It's another day today
It's another day today
Alone he's alive he's alone he's alive This is not another fad
It's another day today
It's another day today
Radio show, radio show
Trust the wizard, here we got
Radio show, radio show
Trust the wizard, can't say no
It's another day today...
Be a motorcycle
Be a getaway car
Be a house of sparrows
I am waiting
This is where you are
Thinking about the lines that cross the sky
Mine for you and I
Never have to die
I have plans engaging
All of these points connecting one
My trap is simple
I will forgive you
For all you've never done
Lessons of the crime of sick and tried
In a forest crucified
You're gonna never have to die
Deliver this message to the one I love the most
I've lost all my money to a 300 pound ghost
Squeaky was a sad child - the product of neglect
Got stung by a jellyfish demanding her respect
Demons are real
They are standing still
Demons are real
They are standing still
Fabulous
Just fabulous
I wanted to see
I wanted to kill some time
I was captured
Got captured
Was mortified
Unfortified
Fixed my eyes on beautiful pies
It's how I met my mother
Chocolate boy
You fell into the summer
And neither neither none
Of all the good you've done
Could turn our happy factory
Once again from bummer
Paper man
Exposed a nasty rumor
Of all the fouls we cried
Belied and Bowdlerized
For our hypocracy
And nepotistic humor
The best of opera
And dutch chocolate finger play
The test at the exit
Of the entrance we will know
A concrete heart sinks slow
And chocolate kings adore
A chocolate painted floor
A look out down before
And then the summer made
A chocolate boy no more
Innocent or sweet
Shooting missiles in the street
They are deceiving
Seeing isn't hard but not believing
You've got the right to bite
The hind that feeds you
Delayed reaction brats
With all your multicolored hats
Are you excited?
But what's been building up
To be ignited?
You've got the right to fight
The hind that bleeds you, needs you
I know this party hat
I know this crown
I believe the study of ratings
Will bring the honest man down
Bring the honest man down
In the town of mirrors
I'll try to put on
My proper playing clothes
I wanna see the magic
You are the first one I chose
In the town of mirrors
Put your hands & feet together
Heads, hearts & nebula
The good god is breathing
Oh, alright (mutilation)
I want to start a new life
With my valuable hunting knife
She will shine like a new girl
And I want to shout out our love to the world, hit it
Everything I think about I think about
Everything I talk about I talk about with you
But you don't know what I go through
You don't know
Days, they will turn into nights
But my valuable hunting knife
It will not rust through the tears
And it will not lose its appeal over years, come on
Everything I think about I think about
Everything I talk about I talk about with you
But you don't know what I go through
You don't know
I'll never know
I'll never know
And then I will run
And then I will. . 
And then I will hide
And then I will. . 
And then I will run
And then I will. . 
And then I will hide
I'll never know
I'll never know
It's her again oh oh
She's a little disturbed again oh no
And I'm feeling down again so it goes
Circling round like trouble and toil
A princess boiling milk
They thought she was a witch
And when they poured it on her
She didn't melt
And I'll bear no guilt
It's her again oh oh
She's a little disturbed again oh no
And I'm feeling down again so it goes
Circling round like the juggler of the stars
The monster of the moon
It's happening too soon
Time to say to you, my child
Your name is Wild
And if you called me in
To change the color
Your name is Wild
And I'll be taking you soon now
To read the orange signs
And I say now to you, "So what?"
The useless fade in time
You chose me to read you no lies
Hooray for the day
And I'll pray for the angels to keep you, my child
You are safer now
God knows it, too
Time to say to you, my child
Your name is Wild
And if you called me in
To change the color
Your name is Wild
And I'll be taking you soon now
To read the orange signs
And I say now to you, "So what?"
The useless fade in time
You chose me to read you no lies
Hooray for the day
And I'll pray for the angels to keep you, my child
You are safer now
God knows it, too
AhhhhAhhhhAhAhAhhhhAhAhAhhhhAh
Wanting to choose
Fight the scene through unreknowned leaders too
And nothing is real
She found me someone who wants to stone cheaters too
And I think it's cool
Finding out yr not one of the bleeding few
And just like in school
Yr following every unsane leader
Cool as long as you weed them out
Fool says nothing but breeze
For all the things for you
And all these things are new
So unbelievable now
In finding freeways through unreknowned leaders too
(nothing could be finer than viewing this in paragraph form!)
Constant gray-haired hunters are after me, on the collision course
In the room of the lie detectors. Someone's ideas are a joke, but this
One is all mine. And that's what bothers me, like my father before me
And the mothers that bore me. There is always going to be the test team
And qualifiers. I'm on the cutting edge of humility. Just like Jerk said
I ain't gonna worry no more
Turning
And burning
Then cooling
Now living born
Fill the stars
In me
And now me
And hear me
And know me
My will so far
And then I recall
Caveman
Child I'm coming
To show you
And know you
And warm your heart
Don't let them tell you
To send me away
And just wave us apart
Come in from the cold
Can you?
And then I recall
Caveman
Cling to the sides, brain-boy
We lost our numb-er selves in jail
Leaving a groovy wit matter on a sailing sky
Alive and jabberstroking
Sinking around you now
Around you now
Around you now
Sinking around you now
Around you now
Around you now
Wings are wise, lame-boy
Louder people build a fighting bore
Dig the fast track, fucker
Ancenstral public dig the fast track!
He's the one with the talkin' rock-bull
Clings to edge of the pool
Greg Case
Examine number one
At cause and at manners
Bounded to protect, a fighting bully
Go around you now
Around you now
Around you now
Sinking full, around you now
Around you now
Around you now
On a silent sky
Dig the fast track
Alive and jabberstrokin'
Dig the fast track fucker
Think of a wide lane, boy
Dig the fast track
Promise you will go and fight
Dig the fast track, fucker
Access to the priveleges
Dig the fast track, fucker
Dig the fast track, fucker
Dig the fast track for her
Dig the fast trip
Dig the fast track
Well the simpleton at arms
Is protecting the village's prettiest girls
But now they're running far away
Because the washing isn't done
And they lived a life of grounding
In a closet at the foundation
And now they aren't available
To the simpleton at arms
And returning thus to the simple life
(At the farms)
Under the iron shop
The farewell ladies wink
Always promising
No one to crush them
Always pokerfaced before bingo
Does it snap or just happen?
But a queen's prize awaits
She might rub her legs
But a queen's prize awaits
Currently fabulous
And perhaps at last
The song you sing will have meaning
But a queen's prize awaits
She might rub her legs
But a queen's prize awaits
She might rub her legs
But a queen's prize awaits
She might rub her legs
But a queen's prize awaits
She might rub her legs
I'm awaken
To the sound of a deafening horn
I'm shaken
By the creak of an opening door
As the waves crash around me
I'm breaking
Cracking my heavenly bones
And a vision
Of a vision won't leave me alone
I'm falling
But the ground keeps falling away
I can see you
But I couldn't say where you are
As the waves crash around me
Man, there's a whale out of water
Lord, there's a bone on a string
Doin' everything the hard way
Doin' everything the hard way
Still there's release for the wicked
Weak feet and tired arms, watch them flail
Cold and pale, the hard way
Cold and pale, the hard way
And so we drown in the animal sea
The factory of human pride
The place where I was born
The place where my father died
Last but not least there's an army
Marching like stoned ghosts in hell
Into the wishing well, the hard way
Wishing well, the hard way
Doin' everything the hard way
Doin' everything the hard way
Doin' everything the hard way
Doin' everything the hard way
Doin' everything the hard way
Doin' everything the hard way
Doin' everything the hard way
We're doin' everything the hard way
Look inside your pocket, Mitch
Look inside your head, Mitch
Through me in line, Mitch
Throw me your hand, Mitch
Ooh
Look inside your pocket, Mitch
Down by the racetrack
Stand on your head, Mitch
Down by the racetrack
Smoking cigarettes
Down by the racetrack
Playing your guitar
Down by the racetrack
Ooh
Down by the racetrack
Say it! (Ooh) X10
To see the light and try but fail
On jagged seas that can't be sailed
And sought to lead but always trailed
Asked questions anyway
And all around the breeding grounds
The nymphos sweetly played
The queen of cans and jars will keep them safe
To be so keen on global trend
To be so tight on how and when
To scratch and claw until the end
To work for each new day
And all around the hunting ground
The dead were on display
The queen of cans and jars will keep them safe
Systems crash, systems crash
Chorus
Systems crash the universe
All emotions are flying
Systems crash the universe
All the systems are dying
Are you watching us watch you?
Are you, are you watching us watch you?
Are you watching us watch you?
Are you watching over black screen?
Are you writing her the blank page?
All the systems are dying
Chorus
Falling all over the globe
Falling all over the globe
Falling all over the globe
Noticing the change
We are taking time
Everybody knows
Everybody's fine
And we'll figure out
Purpose in the end
Unless we have to jump
Unless we have to win
Hold your tongue
Brace yourself
Give me a kiss
Show me what I missed
Can I find a phone
Can I drop a dime
Can I get a loan
Running out of time
And I'll have a toast
To what it's all about
Unless they move us on
Unless they move us out
Hold your tongue
Brace yourself
Give me a kiss
Show me what I missed
Seven doglegs hung to dry
In the woods that way
Postal blowfish make me cry
It works that way
Begging on the nail don't fail
To clue me in
??Cluster frogs and crabs begin??
My automated spouse
Has a bug in her blouse
Invading my private space
And secretly she sees
And secretly she sees
And secretly she sees
And secretly she sees
And secretly she sees
My cyber-son has found my gun
My favorite son has found
My favorite son has found my gun
And now the fun begins
And now the fun begins
And now the fun begins
And now the fun begins
And now the fun begins
And now the fun begins
And now the fun be-
Now the fun begins

With vampires of the rocket were free
Single files in porpoise language
Long and languid, then we'll go to sleep

Blonde machine in yellow spacecar
Zip your legs in smooth rubber
You pass me and harass me
#1 is on the run
I saw you outta my cave
You didn't see me
You never see me
Ugliest affairs in print
Jumbled societies' children
Where'd you pop in?
Blonde machine....
All the glands that you shoot through
Tight globes
International she goes out
Fresh from the sweat factory I'm in love tonight -
Perhaps we'll be best friends for a week
I want to let you know, I want to let you be
I want to feel the sky, I want to feel the sea
I want to dominate, I want to watch it grow
Why can't you let me see
Why can't you let me know?
Wicked windows celebrate
A new throat culture
The speaking is easy
Then you don't have to watch your tongue
Don't talk, I'll split if you want me to
Not a word
Action speaks volumes
Turn up the screen
It's a blast, it's a blast
________ Past
And I don't have to listen anymore
Don't talk, I'll split if you want me to
Not a word
Action speaks volumes
Don't talk, I'll split if you want me to
Not a word
Action speaks volumes
All I can think
All I can say
Is not good enough
Demons real
I got to try yeah
Blue moon star
?Go to the stream?
Got for you to show me on
?It cheapens for a wink?
Animals waiting
Children playing
In the blue moon
Blue moon
Gone...the devil... aw
The kids are waiting
?Got to shake it?
In the blue (yelling)
When she needs a public apology
Silence will do
Up in an ugly room everybody dances
Soul train college policeman
Man, it's the age stars and stripes
Finger to the room
Baby stay shaking
Laughing and baking
Post Christmas cupcake hand-grenades
Soul train college policeman
I have emotional scars
And I don't understand what you're saying
Lying an accomplice of mine
Feeling that something's gonna blow
And watch where you go
I'm the drinking Jim Crow
Ah, as you know our traditional game
And oh, we mark it of a nasty little nation
Drinking from the fire in the well
Extracting all the venom from the snake
Be careful you know
I'm the drinking Jim Crow
And the blessings bestowed
And the costumes we froze
And the master of races
And the fun pointed faces
And the killing of time
I'm the drinking Jim Crow
Better look where you know
Better look where you go
See you around, yeah
I wanted to call you around
See you around, yeah
I wanted to call you around
Could you?
Could you keep a secret from me?
Yeah, could you?
Could you keep a secret from me, yeah?
See you around, yeah
I wanted to call you around
See you around, yeah
I wanted to call you around
When I'm alone I can see no sky
When I'm alone I can see no sky
When I'm alone I can see no sky
Could you?
Could you keep a secret from me, yeah?
Could you?
Could you keep a secret from me, yeah?
...so high...
Starts off her day
With a Kristy Kreme doughnut
As sweet as life can get
Runs out to play
With the promising uncles
Who promise her a pet
She likes the good humor man
She likes his song
When everything goes right for her
When everything goes wrong
She turns around
At the heart of the drop beat
To let them all check out
Look what she's found
When the gawkers and squawkers
Exchange their costumes
She loves the good humor man
He says they don't call us that
She'll run like the wind
Through the street scene and hand
A doughnut to her snowman
Doughnut for a snowman
Damn good Mr. Jam
Hoping to be the pig I am
The pig I want to be
The pig I've always been
Subscribe to my church
I'm damn good Mr. Jam
I'm damn good Mr. Jam
Phyllis the pretty Philadelphia
Anybody can get nothing free
Trained her monkey boy
Tripped on luggage for the money
??Handout?? for money
??Handout?? for money
Money man
Slippery man
Toasted man
Anything for free x 11
Stay close at hand, you know
The bar begins where rooted boundaries end
Stay pure and hard to go
The ocean breaks against the adverse wind
I hear you crying
You're only a lifetime away
I feel you dying
Relying on what the people say
She lives in solitude
Behind the room is sewn, the web she spins
He stalks oblivious
Pushing, pulling in an adverse wind
I hear you crying
You're only a lifetime away
I feel you dying
Relying on what the people say
I hear you crying
You're only a lifetime away
I feel you dying
Relying on what the people say
I hear you crying
You're only a lifetime away
I feel you dying
Relying on what the people say
I hear you crying
You're only a lifetime away
I feel you dying
Relying on what the people say
I hear you crying
You're only a lifetime away
I feel you dying
Relying on what the people say
Fight me
Fight me in practice
Up from a squelch
A ten point power plant
No planning a rant
You get a clear man
Hunting a heart
Backed away in his pig
Father Sgt. Christmas Card
Gone jogging
Gumming the fun tunnel
And answer to no one
And not knowing this
So God bless you
Continue to speak
Oh, God, bless you!
Fa la la la la
Oh, God, bless you!
Fa la la la la
I found you a place to hide
And you were run out before my eyes
The sun seems too hot for your ways
That you gleam "who cares" and you play
Waving at airplanes, over the tree tops
Where can you go now
While you're waving at airplanes
But you chased the tail of dawn
And I thought this was wrong
The sun seems too hot for your ways
That you gleam "who cares" and you play
Waving at airplanes, under bridges, over clouds
How will you live now
While you're waving at airplanes?
Shoot me down, shoot me down
Shoot me down to the ground
Waving at airplanes, waving at airplanes
Waving at airplanes, waving at airplanes
How did you get there?
What do you see there?
I'll come and meet there
Why you're waving at airplanes?
Let's invent a priest
Brag of bread and water
A burning glass
That throws a shadow
A shadow of the sun
Ask me what's the matter
See the foldout answer
A crying eye
That burns an image
The cause celebre
The fired fruit bowl
In glazed animation
The sun dances inside
And dries the
Intestinal intimacy
Up
She's got the face
She's got the face that makes me happy
I never thought about how lovely it was
Until one day she went over and out
Over and out
Over and out
When will she come back to me
Over and out
She's a disgrace
She's a disgrace to friends and family
I never thought about how lucky I was
Until one day she went over and out
Over and out
Over and out
When will she come back to me
Over and out
Get out your blue bathrobe
Get out the blue babbleships bay
Feed the world
Feed the world
Get out your Cleopatra shoes
We'll take the blue babbleships bay
Round your world and back by house again
So sick of calling your name
That I think I would find you gone
If you're sad and ??it better be king??
Like I play
And I play right along
And it doesn't matter what's said or done
As long as you've had your fun
???? your name and I look out and find you're gone
If you're sad and ??it better be king??
Like I play
And I play right along
And it doesn't matter what's said or done
As long as you've had your fun
You know that you've had your fun
You've still got your gelatin, ice cream, plum
You've still got your gelatin, ice cream, plum
You've still got your gelatin, ice cream, plum
How's your life and cycles?
Compared to your next rival?
A '69 revival?
A '005 survival?
Then disregard unthinkable
And be like the unsinkable Fats Domino
And tell it all around them
Above the swell they found him
On common grounds that drown them
No higher than the fountains
Of water not so drinkable
Except to the unsinkable Fats Domino
Animals sound the trumpets
Wimpy crowns will know
Silence will sink the carpet
Saints will drink and move too slow
They'll be too drunk to know
Beyond normal abilities
And nuclear facilities
It's where the search them found him
It's where we'd like to meet you
The water is undrinkable
Except for the unsinkable Fats Domino
So be light and unsinkable
Make disbelief unthinkable
1, 2, 3, 4
His merchandise is sublime
But don't laugh at the Ha Ha man
While you were gawking I was talking
And squawking with the Ha Ha man
So now I think breakfast is the plan
Are you coming with the Ha Ha man?
Ha Ha man Ha Ha man ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
(It's a ridiculous concept, and everyone's laughing but me)
No transmission
Not from the start
No transmission
In your heart
No transmission
And now you've run me down again
No transmission
Not to begin
No transmission
'Til the end
Your decision
Keep me down and out again
None in your heart
None in your heart
None in your heart
No transmission
Not in your heart
No transmission
In your heart
No transmission
And now you've run me down again
Near a distant sea
Her clear yellow eyes
Are opening to pink and black skies
And soon they are blinking
With compound camera eyes
Are you faster
Than the eyes of the car-people?
Styled in silver
Are you able to roam
Faster then the lighthouse keeper credits you?

Showing cloaks of rubber
Digital relay

It's cold in the morning
Where scenesters exit

In a world you think you understand
Stay put and tune to another planet
It's up to you to stay put
The shoe is on the other foot
Driven to the fields
Whipped like a slave
Ready for out
Ready for the beast, unleashed
Large-hearted boy
In a world you think you understand
Stay put and tune to another planet
It's up to you to stay put

Northern eyes, I'd like to meet you on the dance floor
What was that? realistic men don't speak cliche
Whatever my business is, I still can get off
Meet me then - we'll take Laundry & Lasers
Here's a magnet - round your themes up - take your dreams up
Too much soft rectanglement ensnares the head
Not so high into the sky light should you pray them
Not so low your hands on those you lay
A porcine fellow
Who dwells on the dirt spot
As dead as a death way
Swept clean as a laser
Even though you musn't know I swim the meadows
Even though you musn't know I field the sky
Let's go eat the factory - let's go running in there
Wise beyond the northern eyes
And super spies
And realize much more
These times useless inventions
Satisfy inquiring minds
What about a piece of pretentions
In production of new schemes?
Realize a world of quick fix dreams
Come on and purchase the new one
Be the first to strap it on
Lose antiquated fixations
That you cannot leave about
For a nice try change this model out
Feed on a stroke of brilliance sometimes
To cover up the oldness in your eyes
From noticing the coldness in our lives
Don't know if it's a miracle or a curse
Maybe we can help you to feel worse
These days useless inventions
Simplify or complicate
You've got the keys to the kingdom
That through which you could remove
That from small beginnings must improve
Feed on a stroke of brilliance sometimes
To cover up the oldness in your eyes
From noticing the coldness in our lives
Don't know if it's a miracle or a curse
Maybe we can help you to feel worse
Tap the curiosity of your youth
Are you seeking dead or taking truth?
Never knowing what will come up next
Will it be the panic switch or select?
Well, it's too late to change your connection
Didn't even get through inspection

They cut the skin, they peel back the onion
Reveal the ghost blood
Fat black gas exudes
Moves into the mirrored halls of empty values
Canned sister Iowa
Drive me to the changing room
Where the counterfeit meets
And brings its collection of orphans
Leave them in the state grip
The nurses hate them
But it's up to you and me, my faithful sin-eater
To give them a glorious lightbath
And remove their wrapping
Their burning flag birthday suit
In the days of Cain
With treachery abounding
Up from the ashes came quite astounding
Singing razorblade
A golden fork at dawn
I will try to explain
The reasons we must remember
Singing razorblade
And which will never be the same
Just before the separation
Let us drink our selves into sedation
Share ourselves, dance march and parade
Listen to the sweet sting of
Singing razorblade
Fly into ashes a hole
They will polish you brightly wherever you go
Their ashes come true
They'll bring knowledge unto you wherever you know
Unofficial study guides will help you when you're ready boy
Superficial lacerations they won't hurt you
Exert you into growing out
Fly into ashes a hole
They will follow you into wherever you flow
To ashes so slow that the knowledge you acquire to help you
Ceilings now are clawing gold
They need something reverent and bold
Holding out for the heaven to unfold
Unofficial study guides will help you when you're ready boy
Superficial lacerations they won't hurt you
Exert you into growing out
Ceilings now are clawing gold
They need something reverent and bold
Holding out for the heaven to unfold
Now then on the bright side
Demons do not dare
Nor do I think they care
To join us in a toast
No they never want to boast
If since the letter
Made a deal go sour
On pacts of golden seal
Postmarked
Ain't it funny how it gets there
And they say it never does
I'll replace you with machines
I can't face you
So I wrote a letter
To the messenger of my dreams
I see him at a party
Endlessly
Ain't it funny how it gets there
And they say it never does
I'll replace you with machines
I can't face you
Ain't it funny how it gets there
And they say it never does
I'll replace you with machines
I can't face you

Bad luck, anyway you call it
Red ants and mercy giants
The angels of the bars
They're all wrapped

They're all wrapped to say good morning

Jump in, catch it if you can, jump in, she's floating like an angel
Jump in, catch it if you can, jump in, she's floating like an angel
Jump in, take it while you can, jump in, it's bleeding like a rainbow
Jump in, take it while you can, jump in, it's bleeding like a rainbow
Some birds are blue, the grass is green
Some birds are blue, the grass is green
Some birds are blue, the grass is green
Some birds are blue, the grass is green
Bat my soul
With a broken fist
The kids have gone out
Where the gold is accomplished
Minerals and diamonds
Mothers on track
Alex and The Omegas
A fool proof
Through the roof item
Captains of the action
Ten seconds of the cycle
Shame your cup
The pigeons stole my line
Minerals and diamonds...
Get out alright
Nothing's on
Everything's over
It's the living end...
Hold on to yesterday
Hold on, that's what I gotta say
You want to be with me
And I told you that you could be with me
Hold on to yesterday
Hold on is what I gotta say
Oh you were with me
And I told you that I loved you baby
Hold on to yesterday
Hold on to yesterday
Hold on to yesterday
Hold on to yesterday
Here we go!
Want! You!
Want you
You need me (do you need me?)
You need me oh baby you got it
Hold on to yesterday
Hold on is what I gotta say
Oh I gotta tell you that I love you
And I want you to tell me that you love me
Oh go on, I want you
(Come back baby to me)
Hold on to yesterday...
Finger, finger, finger, finger
Finger, finger, finger, finger

Cherub blown apart
Baby's in the bed
Sit around and mope
Better not
Can't be long from me
Here they linger
Probably in danger
Read it on a flyer
Glisten on the burner
King shows anger, "reign, man!"
He will deal with it later, send them away
Send them away then
Not gonna spank you
And we thank you from all of our hearts
Send them away then
They're developing rashes
Down on the ashes
And after the body-parts
Visiting down there
Trying to cling there
It don't mean a thing there
Warlock bought her
Animal's little daughter
Smiling in spite that she's a spy
While she's singing, an insect stinging
Glowing, winging by
If this one will call you like a tide
It can only breed alone
So alone it flys
To enslave you by the night
You can only weep alone
I'll name you the flame that cries
Yeah we did it
We brought you in this ready
Takes a quick one to find the light
High speed child in motion
And you can't come along for the ride
Yeah we made it with a pitchfork and machete
Wow, that's amazing, can I try?
No dangerous weather is approaching
And we wouldn't want you to slide
Visiting down there
Trying to cling there
It don't mean a thing there
1, 2, 3, 4
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
Sitting in the squirmish frontal room
She says I'm not very cool
But I know better than that
She knows better than that
And I know more than her
And she knows better than that
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
Sitting in the squirmish frontal room
She says I'm not very cool, oh
But I know better than that
She's no better than me
I'm no better than her
But it's not hip, not okay
I say no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
The road to Bozzio
I caught up to see the sight
Lay down the party book
Way down the streets of this town
The road to Bozzio
I caught up to see the sight
Lay down the party book
Way down the streets of this town
???????????????
Coming to town
Come to town
Going to tell
Go to tell
Living without you is difficult
But our dead dreams awake
In my mushroom art
Do not observe her beauty
Cloud-faced old man winking
You see, he tests me
He wants I should join him in gratitude
For his craft
He calls this love
But hardly so
Happy the universe
Happy is the act
A bejewelled crow on a quilted tent
Yea, at the zenith
Our dead dreams awake
Living without you is difficult
But our dead dreams awake
In my mushroom art
I dare not say
The way I feel
About your inability to
Suck it up and win the game
Chew me up and spit me out
It's been a long ugly winter
I need a sunbath, a winning horse
Of course I'm not complaining
I'm simply dying
Yes, I'm waiting
Got a good love left
Good Lord willing
Got a tractor to tow
The house on fantasy farm
The new corn belt
In the new Bible belt
Take me to the pilot light
And sing me to sleep
You fantasy creep
(R. Pollard-Sprout)
Disarm the settlers
The new drunk drivers
Have hoisted the flag
We are with you in your anger
Proud brothers
Do not fret
The bus will get you there yet
To carry us to the lake
The club is open
Yeah, The club is open
Hey, the club is open
A-come on, come on, the club is open
C'mon, c'mon, the club is open
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, the club is open...
Taco, Buffalo, Birddog And Jesus
Taking me out over the sea
I'll be kind enough to read in their guidebook
The hairiest thing we'd agree
They'd been driving a pickup from Plymouth
To make up for the holes in their jeans
As they whistled the spirits above them
The circus matures beneath
Irrepressible ??? of peoples
Winks at the others he knows
But the ones who are left here are nice people
Into the black smoking hole
Nobody opens his eyes
It's hard to look up in the sun
And so they shove them along
In the cross hairs of the apple
Something will carry us along
Takes a hell of a ??? Sunday
And stays till the boat swings along
Nobody opens his eyes
It's hard to look up in the sun
And so they shove them along
Beyond the bars and earth of the mid-western factory towns
People's minds flicker ???
Some of us think it odd that a large percentage of bona-fide miracles were witnessed here today
But I've seen Taco take a big long drag off his self-whittled pipe
And sit back and laugh
As the imminent Rednecks hugging and buying each other drinks
And then Jesus blows the clouds away with one puff
Crawls back into his cage and goes to sleep
Taco, Buffalo, Birddog And Jesus
Taking me out over the sea
I'll be kind enough to read in their guidebook
The hairiest thing we'd agree
Nobody opens his eyes
It's hard to look up in the sun
And so they shove them along
Now turn tonight
The day is done
And it is good and it is fun
We gave ???
And gave you space
You suck it up in from your face (?)
All over the place
The night is long
And I'm a man
I've gotta look at you up the stairs (?)
I can't ??? feel
Just who is it
But it is good and it is there
The day is done
The day is done
And it is good and it is fun...
There's some food upon the table, boys
And if you have ever seen me flying
Then you know that I am weak
And you are free to take me downstairs
Away from cares
I'll be with you in the morning, boys
Cause you know that if we wait for our time
We'll all be dead
Oh now I'll bore you, crying my life away
Don't I know it, always the things I say
Always too far
If you could be anything that you want to be
Do you think that you would be who you see in the mirror?
If I look long enough, my face would start to change
If I look close enough, I'll take away the pain
Oh I don't care anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
I'll be with you in the morning, boys
Cause you know that if we wait
For our time
Then we'll be there
In the evening
She calls for time
A beckoning
Upon each cozy corner
Talking ones ??a cocking hit??
Oh oh
In the morning
She crosses lines
??Of cocking pitch??
??A fatting?? moment
A child in chime
A locking hitch
Oh oh
If you chance to break your neck
Upon the slippery what the heck
Your older will stand in line
And break their necks all the time
Oh oh
And so take another drink
Everybody please stand back
And pray godspeed and dare to move
La la la lo lo lo
Oh oh
Gurgling, gurgling all the way home
Keep it in motion
Keep it in line
Keep it in motion
Keep it on time
Walk it down the line
Walk it all the time
Keep it in line
Keep it in motion (Keep it in motion)
Keep it in line (Keep it in line)
Keep it in motion (Keep it in motion)
Keep it on time (Keep it on time)
Walk it down the line
Walk it all the time
Keep it in line
Keep it in motion, keep it in line
Keep it in motion, keep it on line (in motion)
Keep it in motion
Keep it in motion
Keep it in line
Everybodies got their head up high
Everybody should be touching the sky
But you know you never nevercan go down
So you slow down and you walk away
She says good morning to you
And you look away
She asks you just what to do
You don't know what to say
But well what can be done
And what can be done for you
I'll tell you now
Where will you go
When nothings laid out for you
Hope these are worthwhile
Dying to try this
Mark Benedetti
Look out to see me
I'm comin' up
I got a white flag in my pocket
I think you know how I feel
What's the agenda
What were you thinking
A white flag in my pocket
I think you know how I feel
This time is real
Come to me
Say you will, say you won't
Come to me
Say you will, say you won't
Come to me
Say you will, say you won't
Come to me
Say you will, say you won't
And I must get high when I'm workin' that line
And I must get high when I'm workin' that line
Come to me
I'm workin that line, don't hide, come to me
Come to me
Say you will, say you won't
Come to me
Say you will, say you won't
Come to me
Say you will, say you won't
Come to me
Say you will, say you won't
And I must get high when I'm workin' that line
And I must get high when I'm workin' that line
Come to me
I'm workin that line, don't hide, come to me
Come to me
Come to me
Come to me
Come to me
Come to me
Come to me
I never liked you until I
Took a good look at myself
And when I saw you there
I saw the best part of me was yourself
It's like soul man
It's like soul man
I never liked you until I
Took a good look at myself
When I saw you there
I saw the best part of me was yourself
It's like soul man
It's like soul man
It's like soul man
It's like soul man
It's like soul man
I am an earthworm following
There is a nighthawk watching me
Crawling
La la la la, it's a lonely night
I'll take the airwaves home tonight
Crawl with me into the hole
Where everyone can hide
We're in the wormhole
Seeking to be safe again
Without a single brave soul peeking out
Tonight
Tonight
After the fire, there's a falling rain
Washing us free from the daily pain
Off the hook and down the drain
And out to the other side
To where the soil is rich and muddy
In the riverbed
Feed on the urgent promise of the dead
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
I celebrate
Far too - but not exceeding my potential
Risking injury - this is music for people 1,000 years old
Slapping salt on soldier boy, his guts in his cupped hands
The horses breathing freon
With engines gunning the lord is coming
I celebrate over the sketches of a deteriorating landscape
How can a sissy play ape without risking injury?
Hurts me, minds you in the dark
Come outside and play the spark
Ragged enzyme horror shows
Half smiles of the decomposed
I know
Fit me into your thimble
I'll be your comeback trail
All wheels and no control
A restless shadow, oh
Skeptic having dates and facts
Handy with the battle axe
Home is not your woman's head
Play the spark is what I said
I know
I know
You're gonna fuck up my make-up
You're gonna make up my fuck-up
They call me Sleep Over Jack
Now serving confident product
Icepick in the heart rate
And you will never be next
I know
With your mission wilting
And your kids sulking
Happy birthday, Mr. Sink
Throw your flowers in the river and drink
We've got cowbells and clay
Make us all obey
And work will be of worth
For the sketch of explorers
And the hot air annoyers
Good men destroyers
Future employers
Cowboys and lawyers
And we all will be warriors
Sha-la-la and sha-la-lee
I'm up instead of running
Sha-la-la and sha-la-lee
I'm thinking it over
A door is much smaller to see
An entrance on which we'll agree
Sha-la-la and sha-la-lee
I heard a tree falling
Sha-la-la and sha-la-lee
A curtain miscalling
A stage left much smaller, you see
An entrance is only for me
For me, for me
Sha-la-la and sha-la-lee
Just how up and running can one be
Sha-la-la and sha-la-lee
Just how up and running can one be
Sha-la-la and sha-la-lee
Just how up and running can one be
Sha-la-la and sha-la-lee
Just how up and running can one be
Sha-la-la and sha-la-lee
Just how up and running can one be
Sha-la-la and sha-la-lee...
When you write
About the boys
Under friendly fire
Dress 'em up in suits
And seek her to kill
Freedom of the will
Ours and, yes, yours
Yesterday, today
Onward marching on
Chameleon
Don't paint your skin
To the color of confection
And turn away
From every ghost you've been
And sure enough
I saw your head
At the tent sale and fire auction
For a taste and a chaser
You're a solid gold debaser
Can you ever be a boy
Again, or have you stopped?
Trade lost hours for a dare
Burn the water, cook the air?
And twenty-one
Is the legal age
To kill yourself slowly
But eighteen
Is the legal age to die
Would I cast my vote
Into the inside shit
I'm often want to crawl
That's all
Don't leave me now to drag my chains
To a rhythm never changing
Lost from found and beaten down
When you write
About the boys
Under friendly fire
Dress 'em up in suits
And seek her to kill
Freedom of the will
Ours and, yes, yours
Yesterday, today
Onward marching on
Forty thousand whores playing pink gun
Day is done
Got a gun
Singing ratboy this
And ratboy that
Turning on the news
Putting on your army jacket
Pink gun pink gun
Day is done
Got a gun
Singing ratboy this
And ratboy that
Jill and Vicky liked to drag-out
Doing anything that they might miss
Ain't no angels in this part of town
Take me on a blatant doom trip, yeah
Take me on a blatant doom trip
We'll go down, smell around
Take me on a blatant doom trip
Slow righteous, no time to back out
Lay all commands at the crack of the whip
I don't care if the rain causes pain
Just take me on a blatant doom trip, yeah
Take me on a blatant doom trip
Sonic boom, legion of doom
Take me on a blatant doom trip
Scags, fags, and scallywags
Blackout
Far too serious and socially hip
Figure it out when it's over, without a doubt
Take me on a blatant doom trip, yeah
Take me on a blatant doom trip
Bottomless hole, rock and roll
Take me on a blatant doom trip, yeah
Bottomless hole, rock and roll
Take me on a blatant doom trip, yeah
Bottomless hole, rock and roll
Take me on a blatant doom trip, yeah
Bottomless hole, rock and roll
Take me on a blatant doom trip, yeah
Bottomless hole, rock and roll
Take me on a blatant doom trip, yeah
Bottomless hole, rock and roll
Let's sit in the sun
'sencion if the sun should be sunlight in
Send its sound
Unto you, dead cloud
On high
She said to send the sunlight to me
Send the sunlight to me
She said to send the sunlight to me
Send the sunlight to me
Shout from, in the air
Direction in conclusion with when shall be
Count the fires
And for you sweet dreamers
Desire
She said to send the sunlight to me
Send the sunlight to me
She said to send the sunlight to me
Send the sunlight to me
She said to send the sunlight to me
Send the sunlight to me
She said to send the sunlight to me
Send the sunlight to me
Well, come on now and see the course
That never fields the game of choice
And cold allies of steel
Couldn't buy the way it feels
Rusty and divided steel
The race is yet to come
You shout to steal, it's the good resist, you flow so constantly (?)
Crawl back easy (?) between
We can play the quiet game, we can play the quiet game
We can play the quiet game, we can play the quiet game
(?) lose my friend, do you know (?) your blend
If you know through (?) my lane, (?) then
And I can play the quiet game like (?) to
Have you heard the news? Sadness is to end
And I shit you not, I'm going to say it again
Sadness is gonna end end right before your eyes
It's a thing I want to know
It's a good thing, let it go
Water will taste like wine
Have you heard the news? No more f**king blues!
All my dumb luck and all my misgivings
I thrust them aside for the dead, for the living
I want my vehicle, my saucer-shaped coffin
I'm Mighty Pro-Jet
I'm Baron Von Richtofen
(J. Pollard, guitar)
Instrumental
Dig through my window, I will
There is a changeling somewhere
The tide that brought you home maybe
The journey takes you far away from me
Crawling from somewhere out where
There is a never resting longing
But Emptiness is not forever
The Challenge only that for what was left for you
Before you cry awake your morning
Before you last retrieve a breath of pain
I surely may with every word
And every street that seeks no destination
And can now go on
And you pave the way
You pave the way
The time is now
Dig through my window I will
Certainly there a cure is lurking
Past become invests through working
The Challenge only lifts you up
To set you free
Before you cry awake the morning
Before you last retrieve a breath of pain
I surely may with every word
And every street that seeks no destination
And can now go on
And you pave the way
So hey, hey, hey
The time is now
You're all in so fall in
A tear is an ocean
A tear is an ocean
A tear is an ocean
Ooooooh
We are living proof
That God loves us
We are living proof
That God loves us
We are, we are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are, we are...
We are living proof
That God loves us
We are living proof
That God loves us
We'll go to square one
We'll go to square one
We'll say squaring
I looked in to your eyes
And you looked in to my mouth
And you said something
Yeah I'm drawing to a whole
Yeah I'm drawing to a whole
Yeah I'm drawing to a whole
To a whole
We'll get over it
We'll go over it
We'll do something
You looked in to my eyes
And I looked in to my mouth
We'll say something
Yeah I'm drawing to a whole
Yeah I'm drawing to a whole
Yeah I'm drawing to a whole
To a whole
And your morals are the same
Shoot up on the fast lane
She falls like a concrete robot
She's a boy

Discussing Wallace Chambers
I hear you talking
Distorting Wallace Chambers
Obscene, not absurd
Convincing Broderick Lewis
Crawl before walking
Original no-neck savage
Fishing for birds
You walk into the room
Without a broom
To sweep away time lost
At all cost
Wallace hears everything
And Wallace hits everything
And Wallace hunts everything
And Wallace hurts everything
And Wallace hates everything
And
Eyeline the driveway
Eyeblack the door
Sky all around me
Levels life from roof to floor
Trees and knees are lovely
Seek it, find the core
I have grown to life
Like all in silence, wait for more
Everywhere with helicopter
Hard to follow when I'm slow
Everywhere with helicopter
Sending off where lightning goes
I will try to fight them
I will let them nowhere to go
Try escape the pace
I'll say God bless you, let me know
We know the answers
We fill us in
I do not diminish
Start to finish, front to end
Everywhere with helicopter
Hard to swallow when I'm slow
Everywhere with helicopter
Censor of the lightning ghosts
Everywhere with helicopter
Hard to swallow when I'm slow
Everywhere with helicopter
Sending off where lightning goes
My heart is not clean
Your table is green
To collect my things
The harvest of every man
Is in the can
In a single city, a strand in your hand
Where all your men live to study you
And eat you where you live
Get down
Animal action
Animal pace
Animal traction
All over the place
Animal footprints
All over my face
And she's fighter
Now she's fighter
So much heavier than me
Child
Play your style
At rise the heat
Wild
The trails and motion
New beauty secret
She's coming at me like she did
Let's go vike
Let's go vike
I gotta blade and a bike
Let's go vike
Let's go vike
I gotta blade and a bike
Let's go vike
Let's go vike
I gotta blade and a bike
Let's go vike
Let's go vike
I gotta blade and a bike
A man in a gripped(?) white suit
Who commonly hurts when you fly by
I'm not gonna talk to your feet
My single mind's outta style
Big and strong like me
A couple more Jacks
And there ain't no skull
Cupid could be like me
Find me a woman
Find me a woman
Let's go vike
Let's go vike (find me a woman)
I gotta blade and a bike
Let's go vike
Let's go vike (find me a woman)
I gotta blade and a bike
Let's go vike
Let's go vike (find me a woman)
I gotta blade and a bike
Let's go vike
Let's go vike (find me a woman)
I gotta blade and a bike
Let's go vike
Let's go vike (find me a woman)
I gotta blade and a bike
Let's go vike
Let's go vike (find me a woman)
I gotta blade and a bike
I apologize in advance
For the jigsaw's missing teeth
For the animals in their holes, at least
There is argument in your eyes
So I'm loosening all my ties
The ones that you have come to despise
Throw the heat off
Bite me when I eat off
Someone else's plate
It is now I should attempt
Perhaps to think and wait
Result to contemplate a fate
That's waited this long for me
And the night's too bright
To hide from sight
So I better get things right
I keep searching, turning on, equally frustrated
Hopelessness and sickness always, kick you up a storm
A disabled vet, well, I'm not there yet
Been around the block, I even threw up one street over
Absorbed in the holding cell, all blemishes exposed
With the plastic hand of man I can
Stepping up, I go limp at the sound of women laughing
Leaving me to speculate the odds of one last chance
To apologize in advance
I apologize in advance
There is no boy in me now
There is no time and I'm alone
But I am only breathing
Breathing around
I get involved with your crowd
They make me feel so alone
If you could only see me
When I'm around
But this is you and this is war
It makes me drink even more
And I'll have fun then I'll make a mark on you
I'll tell you all that I am
How simple feet will walk for free
Until you injure me again
This is you and this is war
It makes me drink even more
And I'll have fun then I'll make a mark on you
I'll tell you all that I am
How simple feet will walk for free
Until you injure me again
I'd give you everything I've got
For a little more time to analyze the crime
And I don't feel hurt now that you don't write
'Cause I'm used to this shit and they tell me it's alright
And you're so right and I'm so wrong
That we could be lonely before too long
And I don't care if the whole thing's going wrong
'Cause we will be lonely before too long
Just one spark makes a hell of a fire
I'm still wrong, but you're still a liar
Sin begin
Truth be smarter
They say you need to bleed
To go rolling home
Slow from earth
Free of dirt
They say you need to hurt
To go rolling home
There's a kind of love
And it won't be long
But it comes from somebody else's song
There's a world outside with a different view
And it's obvious that it's just for you
There's a kind of love
But it won't take long for me
There's a kind of love
But it won't take long for me
Repeat verse 1
There's a kind of love
But it takes too long for me
There's a kind of love
But it takes too long for me
I'm a man of work and a man of life
Will I work to ??? someone else will buy
Does it ???
??? 'til I feel a wreck
There's a kind of love
But it takes too long for me...
From all sides
We felt sad
We felt so sad
And in our theme
The truth reveal
But we sell fiction
An old clown
In old clothes
Taking up time
(I'm going to spiderland)
Competes for sun
(I'm going to spiderland)
By slapping heads
Send his thoughts through
So come out to war with a sword
He said "Let's do this two shay
On my birthday,"
So you're so proud
And you're so free
And your town votes you
And you're so cold
And you're so sad
And your town quotes you
(I'm going to spiderland)
So come out to war
(I'm going to spiderland)
And sit there bored
And wait till Tuesday
And feel the need
To lose the seed
And smash it gooey
With a toupee
And now is the time
I make up your mind
Marry your uniform
Right now
Remember your first pair of eyes?
And vote for dummy
I'll tell you the truth
Then I'll tell you a joke
The ultimate good move
Life will be a piece of cake
Please find me a river
Develop the film of your life
Right now
Remember to turn off the light
And vote for me dummy...
Please find me an island
It's never wrong
You see it now
You disappear that much
Off in the distance
She's laid out by solution
In her vitality
She's off in the distance
And she's waiting for me
I am Columbus
With wings to take us
I'm taking it back
I'm drinking your wine
I seek the world
You take it back
For reappearing such
Made out of focus
There are silent traps
For you in your thinking
It's closer for grasping
I'm a ring thrower
I am Columbus
With nicotine animals
From recent surgery
Tell me where is your lounge?
And it's never wrong
The point of direction
The choice of the song
The task of selection
The task of selection
The task of selection
Dragons awake!
Take me through the voodoo, Buddha
You are the king of things
I am a fake
Over the treetops, an automan
An automatic girl
Predator skin and orangutan alive
I have two eyes
Sprinkle the pearls over the ham
Grand Peter, might it be the pipes of Pan?
Oh, oh
Softer tits will greet you
But they have been tapped
By suckers of the sap
Now I'm going home
In the distance I can see them
Proudly waving flags
To separate and free them
Dragons awake!
Forever and ever
For everyone to see
Dragons awake!
Dragons awake!
So sing, so sing the winter cows
They lowly croak and no-one wonders where they are
Now they know
Just what will come remains a mystery to me
Now they know
Just what will come remains a mystery to me
To me
Remains a mystery
And when they come into our view they disappear like a lonely star
The winter cows are leaving now
The summer sun is burning their eyes
Their infant eyes
Burning their eyes
Their infant eyes
Burning their eyes
Have you seen that girl?
With the bloodshot eyes
With the razor-sharp teeth
And the hungry smile
It's just a runaway world
It's just a runaway world
It's just a runaway world
It's just a runaway world
Have you seen that boy?
With voluptuous face
He's a concrete bird
And he's the king of the world
Just a runaway world
Just a runaway world
Just a runaway world
Just a runaway world
Hiding behind the mercury curtain
Dark on the ??equinder?? who flies the coop
In the age of transfusion
Busting out for a fast game of motorcycles
He finds a tag reading 'fast japanese spin cycle'
And that's the code for go
And that's the code for go
And that's the code for go
This too, wash away
On human sanitation day
And I will starve to death
Before you feed me
With your tenderness
Greet me
With your slimy hands
You beckon me with open arms
You offer salvation
And I salivate
But it's too late
I'm a dollar short
And that's too bad
'Cause what you got
I wish I had
I seek to know
That you get mad
My final words have fallen upon deaf ears
My last few words have fallen upon deaf ears
(Another Version)
-----------------------------
This to wash away
Give us our protection day
And I will starve to death
Before you see me
With your tenderness
Greet me
With your slimy kiss
Beckon me with open arms
Your salvation
And I salivate
But it's too late
I gotta show (?)
But that's too bad
'Cuz what you got
I wish I had
You seem to know that you been bad (?)
My father was ???
My nasty words ???
Sleephouse, not a sound, the world outside
Large sky losing ground, no words inside
Lost hope brings not the tired eyes
Small and special ground through quiet sound
One mistake, two mistakes
Don't mistake your mistake for my mistake
House pet chasing birds across the earth
Big ground fading now, scope, span, girth
I am an architect
With only one regret
You'll be the only one
Who hasn't cut me yet
You seem like you deserve much more
Than I seem to be cut out for
Toss it back and burn the slack away
I am an architect
I haven't placed my bet
Because I'll never know
Just who you'll f**k next
You seem so surprised when I
Look into your eyes and then I
Toss it back and burn the slack away
She feeds me pieces of ecstasy
Three bites every hour
She licks my brain herself to crumble and fall
I never liked you until I
Took a good look at myself
And when I saw you there
I saw the best part of me was yourself
It's like soul man
It's like soul man
I never liked you until I
Took a good look at myself
When I saw you there
I saw the best part of me was yourself
It's like soul man
It's like soul man
It's like soul man
It's like soul man
It's like soul man

Instrumental
The poised tongues on easy street
Are shifting and delivering
The insidious snakes, the hackers and the meat
Are counting out the face of things
I know when you bring back sweet Dougie's car
You don't tell him where it has been
He's funny and cool and so is your poise
Conditional love wins out again
I'm feeling good and I don't know if that's alright
Deep in the rot I can't distinguish day from night
But all of it will transpire
Transactions made through the wire
Kiss me while I still speak
Hold me as I'm too weak
Enjoy it, delusions
It's pushing closer to the rush
Opening and closing
You recognize me, feel the hush
Long time coming to take my hand away
She says nothing could take the pain away
Something about discussions in the cave
Something about a dream that can't be saved
And all the easy faces funning out of happy places
Gone to the academy
And bloody sonic liars
Into the Navajo amplifier
For us to hear and see
Little star went rolling up the hill
Asked me to come and dance I said, I will
These are the day of preparation still
Some thing is going to happen on that hill
And all the easy faces funning out of happy places
Gone to the academy
And bloody sonic liars
Into the Navajo amplifier
For us to hear and see
And all the ?? graces
Manifest in different places
Their for us to see
And little star keeps saying Indian was angel
Praying calm and patiently
For us our soul in we
And save a place for me
The white lines are tracers
For the facers of the aftermath
Positioned in the situation
Lost in battles of love
Not returning, still learning
Unborn, unhatched
Yet, but wait
It's time to collide, decide, if you will
A purpose for the marchers in orange
And still a circus for the children in disguise
Throwing bones to the drug-sniffing dogs
Protecting what we've come to know as ours
For the colors we wear in our dreams
For the flags we fly in our films
Two connected tongues
Flesh beginnings
But still you couldn't taste
Cyanide in the open skies below us
Below us
A two way street
And oh, we've eaten all the dough
It's our chance to polist Spanky's boots
Finally see we cannot ?? we loath it
But in consolation gives us cash ??
Chorus
Come with high regard from heavy metal country
They write you super-love and seal it with the kick
And now the creator's skull is cracked
Out come the underground with artificial love
They're singing loud, so very proud
To show the mess they made
At Zoo Arcade
When something central took away their guns
Sometimes I'm programmed better than the other ones
Sometimes I'm programmed to shoot the shot around the world
Sometimes I'm programmed
Chorus
Pebble, pebble, pebble, pebble (throughout whole song)
Sip on that fear my (?) one
Suddenly see no change at all
People don't know what's happening
Dream a lot soon much dream won't flow
Shouldn't know mine inside I throw
Can't sure called when the money's gone
Try it all in one, I heard you write, die it all in time
Step on it wheels go rolling home
Stubbornly see no signs at all
Seagulls don't know what they're circling
And I suddenly feel my heroes gone
Suddenly see no change at all
People don't know what is going on
Try it all in one, I heard you write, die it all in time
And now that their field is full of sold
(?) not golden hand or bow
Shall not show, ah-ah-aah
Into my twilight hit won't glow
Shouldn't I choose my own hello
And goodbye, (?) light's calling
It's getting harder to take this I know
Waiting to see how your garden will grow
It's just we're freezing and staring at all of this snow
(taptaptaptaptaptaptaptaptap)
And darlin'
It's not
Easy to spot
But all of this will go
(taptaptaptaptaptaptaptaptaptaptaptaaapppp)
It's not your thing to be patient like this
Even when we'll have no drink and a kiss
But we can still dance in our hearts while we're waiting til spring
(taptaptaptaptaptaptaptaptap)
And darlin'
It's not
Easy to spot
But all of this will go
(taptaptaptaptaptaptaptaptaptaptaptaaapppp)
Darlin', sometimes
These things take time
But all of this will go
(taptaptaptaptaptaptaptaptaptaptaptaaapppp)
Xeno Pariah, get out of the pool, I'll fly you to school
I get some meaning inside of you
I'll tell you what to do
Xeno Pariah, the smile on your face is leaving the trace
And something that hides of you
I'm taking strike with you
Xeno Pariah, I'll try to surprise you, (?) around you
Been denied, the chase is (?), the foot (?) around you
I'm something but that will chase you today
Can change you this way, the range is the rain
The range is the rain, the change is (?)
Will range you the way, the change is (?)
Gonna ride you away on something (?) inside you
Days into weeks
She rattled my mind
We stayed out all week
And got happy this time
She fills empty space
I kinda need it that way
Crybaby says bye to me
I can't imagine that all our troubles will go away
But I could catch her and break the falls
I could snatch her with beaks and claws
Today when every "fake it" decides to make it
They just can't take it away
Shove it, 'cause I'll just stay
Like an ugly unwanted stray
Don't care what you say
Whatever happened to smoggy boy?
They got together
Then he was her toy
And they roamed around the world
Roamed around the world
A lie that's of no aim which follows secrets bleeding to you
Painted over beauty with tattoos of pink and blue
Parlor games in time will rob you of the energy which loves you
Do you see that soon I won't be able to weep for you?
I will weep for you
I will preach the truth but it won't be truth
I will reach for you
I will contact you with an outstretched will because
Some of them are astral city slickers, shrewd and untrustworthy
Leaving you asphyxiated, trapped in a world within
Subtle claws have scratched the lining, leaving you hanging on to your skin
Monitors of your monopolies, though soon they will come again
They will turn you in
They will turn you in and I know they will
They will come again
They were here before and they're after Joe again
When I get tired it always happens
There comes a lonely man saying
Don't walk away from those who wanna reach you
They will reach for you
They will reach for you
They will reach for you
They will reach for you
Many years we spent un-pressured
That we knew so swell
Love in times of simple pleasures
Only time would tell
Oh, this is not to say
We are not the way we used to be
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We were not so fond of reason
Everyone could tell
Even times we'd start to stumble
But never ever fell
Oh, this is not to say
We were not the worst we've ever been
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fools and kings decide
Ways to live your life
This is just the way we want to be
I believe I can't behave
I behave like Uncle Dave
I've got one foot in the grave
Thanks a lot to Uncle Dave
Chorus: Uncle Dave
Raise your hand
Repeat these words
Uncle Dave
The words you've seen and heard
Be ?? to hamster love
What the hell is hamster love
Chorus
You are a pretty strange bird
And fun is for the ??
Circular beast exhibit
Factory of raw essentials
Wrong examples
Palefoot frontrunners
For disease control
And with ease you can roll away the stone
And find no remnants of goodness
Roll away the stone
You'll find no remnants of goodness
You roll away the stone
And find no remnants of goodness
Pelted - I am gassed
On strengthening markets
My thoughts are a gas
I made it to runway
I'll make it to Airway - not to crash
Penetrating water and rock
And the rock echoes back
My thoughts are a gas
(Another Version)
------------------------
Of lights who've faded out before here comes the same
When I'm coded from to much of what I can't describe
Kepat at bay in some regard despite what she wrote
I've been frozen in a site display where nothing amounts
To anything
Took a journey back to sometime just to find out
If I could locate another improbable passage way
Penetrate ? rock and the rock echos back
My thoughts are a gas
I'm not going to crash
Into anyone
And often asked
What do you know
Just what was handed down to me
Slip graciously in to the happy homes
Groping ? frequently opposed
???
Built this champion
Out of their own wasted flesh
Is this supposed to do that
Through it all I'll pass
Cause my thoughts are a gass
My thoughts are a gas
My thoughts are a gas
When the days are older
Yay-yay they and them
Yay-yay they and them
When the days are older
Yay-yay they and them
Yay-yay they and them
Yay-yay they and them
Yay-yay they and them
Yay-yay they and them
Yay-yay they and them
Ah
Praise you body
Into the clan
Save your logic
So you that you can
Pictures of the man
Pictures of the man
You kill him
?Seventy-four?
So you can take his land
Now you've got it
?You were his glands?
Pictures of the man
Pictures of the man
?Acrobats don't flip?
Drinking the sand
Penalty replicate the shroud
Pictures of the man
I need a cigarette, kinda
Here come the fantasy creeps
They're all around you
They're here to give you the creeps
They've come to hound you
Here come the fantasy creeps
Thick walls, they pound through
They know where everyone sleeps
I'm glad they found you
Any time (any time), any time at all
Any time (any time), any time at all
Any time (any time), any time at all
Any time (any time), any time at all
Here come the fantasy creeps
To interrupt your TV show
Here come the fantasy creeps
Re-released on video
Any time (any time), any time at all
Any time (any time), any time at all
Any time (any time), any time at all
Any time (any time), any time at all
Jagged purple rocks
Drunk with the tours and the travel guides
We've all come to Hope Cove
Singing the ??waning?? pop standard
In the haven of our love
Trying to break even
Most of us will not turn back
Somehow I know you will not
Carry all the ancient medicine
Steal my rosy red invention
Gather the amps
And dampen the camps
The day is done
When we see the sun
Perhaps then the race is won
Sail fish like a kite when it rolls by
Sad eyes they will grow like a headlight
Mix up the satellites
Wheel of the sunrise
Feel as its rolling by
Save us light
That gave us night
Save us light
That gave us night
Mix up the satellites
Wheel of the sunrise
Feel as its rolling by
Trendspotter acrobat got no fallin' room
Chocking on an ego size of a ?? rooms
Shows the trends on his coat
Walks out in the rain
Dismayed to see it hasn't rained in days
I will buy the drinks if you promise not to ask me what I think
Hogbutcher diplomat throws up on his shoes
Burpin' up an epigram got these from wounds
Shows the trend on his coats
Staggers through the shine
Say us through the shine
A million bedtime stories on his mind
I will buy the drinks if you promise not to ask me what I think
Trendspotter acrobat look at my new clown clown
Falling apart is as easy as sitting down
Slowly peels off his coat
Throws it on the floor
Nothing really matters anymore
I will buy the drinks if you promise not to tell me what you think
The pipe dreams of instant prince whippet
Announcing the mouth
With the not quit monitoring system
She can hear herself
Whispering through a mirror
On the other side
And on no specifically given day
We see her distance
To this site we testify
I haven't mastered the impulse
Affixed mouth with a cigarette
Give birth to smoke
Aaaaaaaaaah...
Aaaaaaaaaah...
Aaaaaaaaaah...
The pipe dreams of instant prince whippet
Aaaaaaaaaah...
The pipe dreams of instant prince whippet
Aaaaaaaaaah...
The pipe dreams of instant prince whippet
Aaaaaaaaaah...
I don't come around
Never call or let her know
I got a life of my own
You know I hate to be around her
When she's like that
I wrote a song once about her
Called "The Brides Have Hit Glass"
You know it just won't last
To be on top of your own world
With no guardrails to cling to
You fall so very fast
It's very odd to find her up again
Staking out expansion
Seeking new exposure
And when she holds out an empty glass
And she comes for a handout
I ask for the same thing-it's sad
And I hold on so sure I can take all she can
Just to be around her
Just to feel bad
One day I will know
That's it's a waste of time
And there's a better road ahead of me
I just don't know how to make it there
So I'll just hang around and take my chance
Once again I'll roll the dice
And try to hang on to my shrinking paradise
And I'll hold out an empty glass
And I'll come for a handout
And I'll ask for the same thing-it's sad
And I'll hold on so confident
That's it all I can give
To try to find my way back
Just to hit glass
How did I get to know ya?
How could I not?
All the time linking crimes in progress
With previous foul-ups
And we know secrets
And perfect cures
And once the answer
To all God's problems
Escaped us as quickly as it came
But that's O.K
Because all things happen
Standing around
Hoping everything works out
Cause I want them all to work out
You were always so in love with the truth
Why did you change?
Why did you land?
Chorus: Look at the photograph
Nothing is real
Spend another lonely life
With nothing to feel
Was it something
In the stories everyone told you
You needn't heed them
Maybe you should read them
Go back to where you came from
Why did you land?
You couldn't stayed in flight forever
Chorus
Why did you land?
Repeat five times
One, two big school
Big school
Servant to master
Sinister bastard
All the worlds are
Colliding all around you
Knowledge escapes you
Society rapes you
I've got my notebooks
And I'm going back to
Big school
It's the big school
Now we're talking about
The big school
Big school
Now if I could free you
What would you be then
Look at my eyes through the telephoto lens
And notice the traces
Of faraway places
We're both driving my car back to the
Big school
It's a million miles away
And it's in the backyard
The big school
And it's way up on the hill
The big school
Big school
Don't look back
Don't you ever look back
Cause it just might catch you
Big school
Big school
After clearing his throat
The speaker read from the manuscript
"Only forty-percent of all participants have remained alcoholic."
And we began to discuss amongst ourselves
The possibility for a dream-filled holiday
Order for the new slave trade
New flag blowing
We've used up our minds
We had no way of knowing
Old flag burning
We've lost our souls
There'll be no returning
We've diverted back
To the stretch rack
Only this time
We won't snap back
While crossing the parking lot
A stranger approached me
Handed me a gun
He said, "Meet me in the ashes
Of the old city."
And we're bound
To have
Some fun
"Bob, would you and Living Praise Choir lead us into 'Gos Be The Glory'?"
It isn't quite ready
It's almost 5:30
Scholars and flunkies
Faggots and junkies
Incinerator in a blood red sky
Kill the head and the body will die
I can't tell you that I'm happy
But I can tell you that my clothes are snappy
It's time time time time time
Time time time to draw the line
Time time time time time
Time time time to draw the line
Superman died tonight
Ate a pound of Kryptonite
Drank a quart of brotherly love
Fell straight from the sky above
And if there's a hell below
Kenneth Ray ain't gonna go
He lost his soul in the Korean War
I lost my concentration when I opened the door
And it's time time time time time
Time time time to draw the line
Time time time time time
Time time time to draw the line
Time time time time time
Time time time to draw the line
Time time time time time
Time time time to draw the line
Firmly rooted and quite hellbent
The old grunt packs up the hose
And pokes his nose through the old trunk trap
Hurts from years of concentration
Spent in the umpires association
Talking 'bout the next sensation
Up and coming
But now he's strumming
A buzzing one-stringer
Always quite a singer
Did his wife in the dueling banjos....
It runs throughout
The place of fate
She can keep you up to date
And her ???? to intervene
Coming closer in between you now
Between you now x3
And so the plan is up to you
But no one tells you what to do
And if they do you'll make a scene
Nothing will get in between you now
Between you now x7
I'm tired of you
This occasion rattled me a lot
We build our island towers high
Will it fall on me?
A steeple of knives
Caught in core emotions rising
Now our eyes have seen the hurt
Premonition/relapse
Below
I'm riding a bird with no name
I'm trying to be more often
Correct in my response
In a world full of airplanes
In a forest of bars
On the shoulders of a friend
You are kidding when you says let's repeat!
No hitting
We play the game of feet
It's justicide
In a circle of feathers
Photographic cuisine
And we fly on
To the end of boredom
On a bird with no wings...
Perfect birds
Sit on plastic bush
In my cubicle
I've been knowing
This for some reason now
And every day, every day
I expect the delivery truck
To bring me mine
The order is late
But still I wait
For the starfire demon
Or leave it to fate
Slash forward through all suffocate
Do you enjoy coming down with the hate?
Generation X lies in it's sleep
Innocent as angels next to generation Z
In dreamhouse I once was untraced
Visible in screamhouse a new practice space
The chill gets you losing again
Incidentally which pill will you be choosing again?
If you want some
If you need some
Just go talk to her
But we won't apologize for the human race
Inksmears on the meat of my mind
Analyze and obviate disasters grand
Redemption to "get saved quick" kit
Safe to bet you'd sacrifice your children for it
If you want some
If you need some
Just go ask for her
But we won't apologize for the human race
We won't apologize for the humans
An unmarketed product
Is shining clear for many years
The time it takes you to put up
Shut out the fears for many years
How do these things
Come in to our lives
So obtrusively?
Why do they change
Their prices so accordingly?
Well, I can give you credit
Suitable and custom tailored
And if you have any luck
You'll get ahead
Before you're dead
Jimmy was a fly
Got sucked in by an actor
And wrapped in a cocoon
And skin-tight buffoonery
Now, here's the plan...
Scenes from Ester's Day
Of running backward courses
With a horse of different forces
Lying wings of films
That seem to never see the screen
Couldn't bear to face their dreams
Down and out
Couldn't bear to shout it out
Brought up on the road
A sparkle shiny diner
Is the home for wayward minor
In a flying car that seems
To whisper in an ear
"Let's just go, get out of here."
Down and out
Couldn't bear to shout it out
Down and out
Couldn't bear to shout it out
Down and out
Couldn't bear to shout it out
Down and out
Couldn't bear to shout it out
Down and out
Couldn't bear...
And she wants to know which way the wind blows
And which way to go, I'm never gonna tell her
And she wants to know why I'm been hiding myself
Out on the road alone where no one knows my number
And she wants to know why I can't take it slow
And why I can't settle down, but I'm never gonna burn out
She wants to know why I've been lying to myself
Playing a loser's game, fighting a losing battle
Far away, that's where I'll be
Shine a light down hard on me
And she wants to know which way the wind blows
And which way to go, I'm never gonna tell her
And she wants to know why I'm been hiding myself
Out on the road alone where no one knows my number
Far away, that's where I'll be
Shine a light down hard on me
Down hard on me
Down hard on me
Strumpet eye, eye, eye
Draw below
Hey, she got me to go
Every hand grabs
Every moment
Can I see you, strumpet eye?
Strumpet eye
Dig a rare earth angel gone
Strumpet eye
Was cheated in a romance
Strumpet eye
Can barely get into her own pants
That's what he goes with
In time
In time, yeah, strumpet eye
Strumpet eye
Strumpet eye
Strumpet eye, eye, eye, eye
Draw below
Hey, she got me to go
Every hand grabs
Every moment
Can I see you, strumpet eye?
Strumpet eye
Strumpet eye
Strumpet eye
Strumpet eye
Dig a rare earth angel gone
Once she was down and she opened
A crate of secrets darker than she
Underwater explosions
Curtains rippling obviously
She can breathe
Since I've been tired, she can breathe
And the shocks are bound to please
And she points to me
To insist
On facing the salt and it stings
And certainly that changes things
And she points to me
Cups painted orange and sunburst
Lined up side by side, keeps them so clean
Brightly they shine in the starlight
But darker places I've never seen
She can breathe
Since I've been tired, she can breathe
And the shocks are bound to please
And she points to me
To insist
On facing the salt and it stings
And certainly that changes things
And she points to me
Sometimes passes through me
And the sound will carry you on
And the sound will carry you on
I won't put that in my mouth no
It is a fright with that neon light
The Hollywood magic men
Back up in their caves
Ooh at the raves
And the ??cake  ?? can't say
The weepers from the way
Baby it's all right
The night is long and cold as ice
But it's all right, baby it's all right
There's a pink little area
The regions of my disease
And it is good
It is good
Mice feel nice
Ooh mice feel nice
You know mice feel nice ooh
Alright
Alright
Alright
Alright
For our lives to be once again
Like it once was
In the ice age, in a kingdom long ago;
Without songs, without hope, without meaning
And therefore
Always having the same effect
Without ever knowing why
We went ahead, we went ahead
And set it up and knocked it down
You see it falling and now it's crumbling
To the cold, unforgivable ground
You did it, you had a hand in it
And now it's circling around
Oh yeah, it's circling around
I'm coming back to this world
To get things straight
Hey, are you coming? Please don't be late
Hey, are you coming? Please don't be late
Hey, are you coming? Please don't be late
I just can't wait
I dare not say
The way I feel
About your inability to
Suck it up and win the game
Chew me up and spit me out
It's been a long ugly winter
I need a sunbath, a winning horse
Of course I'm not complaining
I'm simply dying
Yes, I'm waiting
Got a good love left
Good Lord willing
Got a tractor to tow
The house on fantasy farm
The new corn belt
In the new Bible belt
Take me to the pilot light
And sing me to sleep
You fantasy creep
(Containment and holder recouped?)
The Indian bearslayer
Contingency moves
Kicks up the slander
Made you race in vanity's airport
I'm the kite surfer
Surrender your families to game wardens
Now the names
Now the briefcase
Now the single cash old ladies
A vending quest of clicking fingers
May I (choose?) another mascot
Are the peace flag and the kicking staff
The ones that groan when the cheeks turn away
These things that will live
In golden blue
Flickering ovens that burn away
Is that what you want?
Is it ?sublime??
A very upbeat self-promotional crime
And now I'm crying
Is that supposed to do that?
Is this why we came?
There must be a scapegoat, my god
There must be someone to blame
And now I'm crying
And now I'm crying
What is it your heart desires, my brother
Wish in one hand, shit in the other
What is it your heart desires, my brother
Shit in one hand, wish in the other
What is it your heart desires, my brother
Wish in one hand, shit in the other

Sparking the showroom
Eyes of concentration
At The Big Hat And Toy Show
Here we heard below
A loud pop
And it was time to go
Down stentorian halls
To the show
Like
Happy
Children go
What's more, what's more important
The run, the run or the finish?
The thrill will soon diminish
You must keep it coming
What's more, what's more important
The substance or the look?
The subject of character assasain
You must keep it coming
What's more important?
When choosing entertainment
Finding the ___________
Selected the sport
You must keep it coming (x3)
What can be more important
Than discovering next generations?
Floating, consuming a lot
Flicking up the dust
And the feeling can wait
You must keep it coming (x3)
Drag days are not too bad but move too slow
I file them, I want them not to linger so
Now we come to drag days
Now we come to drag days
Fake capes baby, they're too hard to wear
Put them on and everyone will stare
We have come to drag days
We have come to drag days
We escape them sometimes
And the feeling is different, more intensified
We escape them within the walls
Of our fidgety hearts where we hide
Way on out beyond the factory yards
Up and over the security guards
We have come to drag days
We have come to drag days
We escape them sometimes
And the feeling is different, more intensified
We escape them within the walls
Of our fidgety hearts where we hide
They will turn around
They will turn around
They will turn around
They will turn around
They will turn around
Let me tell you a story
Conclusive, based on fact
Long ago in the morning
She left, did not come back
I don't really care anymore
I don't really care
Change the days into nights
And you will know when the feeling is right
This tale is too long
The plot is weak and the characters wrong
I don't really care anymore
I don't really care
But she changed my life
I thought she loved me
And I will pray for you
To see the truth
'Cause that's how it's got to be
Oh oh oh, yeah (ooh)
Let me tell you a story
About the way she was
Let me tell you a story
About the way she was
Hey Mr. Soundman, could you turn me up
I don't know you name
But you don't know me either
You lie to your friends
And I'll lie to mine
Let's not lie to each other
Hey Mr. Soundman x3
Could you turn me up
I don't know you name
But you don't know me either
You lie to your friends
And I'll lie to mine
Let's not lie to each other
Hey Mr. Soundman x3
Look me straight
Now blame it on loneliness
Who knows?
Certainly not them
Where is this?
The lane that takes you head on
But for now
You do not/cannot contemplate
Certainly not you
And silence is dread
'Cause look what you've done
Aligned outside no aim
Which follows me
Painted over a well cleansed abdomen
Tattooed ugly and blue
The enemy
Watch and wait
A childproof survival kit
Just for a glimpse
Of the everlasting big kick
Secrets bleeding to untold families
Lovers in flight over the gravesite
We become statues
In a ten acre garden
I tried to find you
I waited all night
Don't have an X-ray
Don't have no laser light
So hang up and try again
I wanted you to
Make a man right
I had you
I like you
So hang up and try again
Alright!
Pants on
Shirt on
Red light
Dead light
I wanted to teach you baby
I wanted to reach you maybe
I wanted to keep you in Marblehead
Hang up
Hang up
Hang up and try again
If you could imagine this
You're not to blame
This is one thing that you missed
I know it's not the same
Bathe your wounds in healing oils
Poison in rain
I'm the scavenger of spoils
Too proud to plead insane
Realize the entertainment
Rise above the self-containment
Compromise will be the arrangement
For the cocksoldiers
And their postwar stubble
And dream tonight
Repeat all but the second part
Naked scarred feet
That make all of us
Go without packing
A troubled customer
Turned away - unsatisfied
Just go
With letters missing
He writes his past
Gone - we lost him
Go without packing
Not welcome here
The hopeless language
The quicksand fear
Go without packing
No coatsleeve tricks
Go love yourself
Just go
In my mind
There are dreams of me??
Following white??
See the form before my eyes
Wouldn't Jesus be surprised
If ??in colony??
The way to see
And if color be
The way you see its
Distant greetings
Six guns alone, an emotional avalanche
Six bottles of rum, and a kilo full of character change
I don't have to come out on my own, barricade
I walked into the line of fire and took it on the chin again
And I can't find my medication or my occupation
But please don't show me the things I should see
In the finger paint I've been dabbling
With the sixty vessels of the ocean
In the cryptical lie of the fashion world
I become the aggressor of no one
Takes a stronger wind to blow out this candle
Than the other fires I've made
And the lying mouth won't blow my handle
Knocking down my barricade
Blowing up my barricade
Little child, little child
Little child won't you dance with me
Little child, little child
Little child won't you dance with me
I walk out in the blinding light and took it on the chin again
And I can't find my medication or my occupation
And please don't show me the things I should see anymore
Go away and leave me alone to work the crossroad
Runaway train, I need to find a long lost brother
Bound and gagged, I feel the need to think it over
Lost my home, don't find my home
Let me walk, I can stand
On my own two feet
I don't care what you do
I don't like you
Be a clown, be a man
Be all you can be
And you don't have to stay
It's all over now
Sometimes I cry because you don't love me no more
And sometimes I'm dying, I'd be lying if I tried to ignore
The hurting inside that started when you walked away
And each night reminds me, it's behind me
But I need you today, I need you today
Every moment speaks hovering silently in the air
The wind hammers like a drum
Every highway leads into a darker sea of despair
Turn you back to where I come from
And sometimes I cry because you don't love me no more
And sometimes I'm dying, I'd be lying if I tried to ignore
The hurting inside that started when you walked away
And each night reminds me, it's behind me
But I need you today, I need you today
Everything she said twisting around and moving inside my head
More confused than yesterday
And when I go to bed, the trucks on the freeway sing me a song
This rock just ain't a safe place to hide under anymore
Ain't a safe place to hide under anymore
And sometimes I cry because you don't love me no more
And sometimes I'm dying, I'd be lying if I tried to ignore
The hurting inside that started when you walked away
And each night reminds me, it's behind me
But I need you today, I need you today
There is no boy in me now
There is no time and I'm alone
But I am only breathing
Breathing around
I get involved with your crowd
They make me feel so alone
If you could only see me
When I'm around
But this is you and this is war
It makes me drink even more
And I'll have fun then I'll make a mark on you
I'll tell you all that I am
How simple feet will walk for free
Until you injure me again
This is you and this is war
It makes me drink even more
And I'll have fun then I'll make a mark on you
I'll tell you all that I am
How simple feet will walk for free
Until you injure me again
A bump is like a friendly letter
We are likely to enjoy a night together
Everybody is over here
Come on over don't be queer
Before I kill it tell me something
Why did you hide your plastic money
And this thing you like to sing
Perched up like a polynesian
Deathtrot and warlock riding a rooster
Deathtrot and warlock riding a rooster
A letter to the captain
A letter to the colonel
A lot has transpired
Since last we addressed you
Storm brews ??New Hocksticken?? vineyards of Toledo
Storm brews ??New Hocksticken?? vineyards of Toledo
I'm waiting for the signal
The promise from the troopers
Liaison of the scarecrow
Hey o now I know
Deathtrot and warlock riding a rooster
Warlock riding a rooster
Warlock riding a rooster
How's my drinking?
I don't care about being sober
But I sure get around
In this town
To hell with my church bells
And leave me die
With you
I won't change
You tell me you've come to your senses
The coast is still in sight
Eureka signs, I'm slowing down
You helped me to remind you
You told me to remind you
Hell in the eye of consensus
Approaching sheds of night
In bleakness, blind as the ocean's mind
You want to look behind you
You told me to remind you
The sinful lie
Offends you every time
Assailants' oversight
Their vision has no right
You want me to remind you
You tell me you've come to your senses
The coast is still in sight
Eureka signs and I'm slowing down
You told me to remind you
You told me to remind you
The sinful lie
Offends you every time
Assailants' oversight
Their vision has no right
You want me to remind you
Every day it's the godawful same
I wanna go solo and drive
You told me to remind you
You told me to remind you
You told me to remind you
You told me to remind you
Oh, to speak on one's feet
To beat on one's brain
The popular mechanics are at it again
A tenement filled with side-show freaks
Assembled to downgrade
An impeccable arrangement
By the soft-rock renegades
And give me time to light
A sentimental torch tonight
I'm a big fan of the pigpen
Sharper than most
Cut with exacto
Gone is all good
Ex post facto
Ba-da-ba-da...
Oh, oh...
When you come around
I can still be found in another world
Pick a number or a name
It's my favorite game in another world
Hey man, what was that we said?
I'm going deaf
I chase the widely open spaces
Built in my head
Can't make out what you say
Won't pretend to even care in another world
When it all gets bad
Everything turns off in another world
Hey man, what was that we said?
I'm going deaf
I chase the widely open spaces
Built in my head
And the shadow of the adversaries
Filled and I shall play
Pass the plate and let us pray
'Cause it's only a trick of the light
Can't make out what you say
Let me pour out anyway
Paid up weathered and type-o
Clad in gladstone watch him go
Swimming beneath the microscope
Hello lonely bless the nation
Missed a skip to all or none
Wooden soldiers fall upon
Try to find what makes her tick
While their finding out what makes them sick
I don't know where you find your nerve
I don't know how you choose your words
Speak the ones that suit you worse
Keep you grounded, sad and cursed
Circle the ones that come alive
Save them for the best of Jill Hives
Been around and left you flat
Tragically decided that
Every child of god's a brat
And she's dying to escape them
But do we really need to see
All her punchdrunk history
And which of it might hold the key
For the exit to her destiny
I don't know where you find your nerve
I don't know how you choose your words
Speak the ones that suit you worse
Keep you grounded, sad and cursed
Circle the ones that come alive
Save them for the best of Jill Hives
Number one in all our souls
Trifle in the crystal bowl
Fill it up with 9 to 5
Save them for the best of Jill Hives
My tongue that moves slow
A minute before the evil street
Breath woman captures a ghost
Blurring sweat heads eat noodles
Sit up and beg
For slivers of language
That the night air might offer
Pin back your ears and feed
All right
Now you call me up
To tell me that you're lonely
I won't make things up
And tell you that they're only for you
'Cause that wouldn't make you feel any different about me
Without me
A message to the paper girl
Don't fall apart so easily
Don't cry too much, you'll get all wet
And that don't make much sense to me, you see
'Cause that would mend my heart and I won't feel blue
That's not true (that's not true)
I need more but it's not like me to fuss
With the problems of us
When it's likely to be in this state with me
But here I go again
And the paper girl's gonna blow away
And it's one game that I won't play
For you
For you and me
Oh yeah, I'm going to drive my car
Oh yeah, I'm going to go real far
As we were sitting there in the final stages
Staring at the screen as the battle rages
You were finding God in the dictionary
Taking photographs in the cemetery
Oh yeah, I'm going to drive my car
Oh yeah, I'm going to go real far
Beyond the shadow of a doubt
Beyond the power of your clout
The worst offense is intelligence
Your best defense is belligerence
How we stalemate our predicament
Governed by tissue and filament
Oh yeah, I'm going to drive my car
Oh yeah, I'm going to go real far
Beyond the shadow of a doubt
Beyond the power of your clout
Beyond the secret bogus world
Beyond the Montezuma Halls
Beyond the shadow of a doubt
Beyond the power of your clout
Beyond the secret bogus world
Beyond the Montezuma Halls
Beyond the shadow of a doubt
Beyond the power of your clout
Beyond the secret bogus world
Beyond the Montezuma Halls
Beyond the shadow of a doubt
Beyond the power of your clout
Beyond the secret bogus world
Beyond the Montezuma Halls
Beyond the shadow of a doubt
Beyond the power of your clout
Beyond the secret bogus world
In the window of my world I see the sunlight
I see the moonlight
Crashing through my world
Yeah, in the window of my world I pry a mystery
Projecting my misery
In the window of my world, in my world
A wall once blocked my view and I couldn't move it
Got bruises to prove it
And maybe I was hurt
But I don't make myself to blame, I broke a small light
Make everything all right
In the window of my world, in my world
Give me your number
Give not my freedom to release you
Seek me in slumber
Take me in words that so complete you
Touch me in worlds that I might reach you
Give me your number
Give not my freedom to release you
Seek me in slumber
Take me in words that so complete you
Touch me in worlds that I might reach you
In the window of my world, a heart's birth brings meaning
Kicking and screaming
In the window of my world
Yeah, in the window of my world shoulder to shoulder
And I'm feeling bolder
Crashing through my world, in my world
Will the wind that scatters dust
Reveal its secrets, speak to us
Of many things?
In the morning when she comes
The bird who wakes you with her song
She'll beat her wings
She will rise again
And ride a perfect high
And find a sweet seed growing
And never know why
She sees anything
One more inch for no more reason
Go without you even yet
And death you sing
Pass it by with once discovered
Time to stop wasting time
What will you bring?
You will rise again
And ride a perfect high
And find a sweet seed growing
And never know why
You hear anything
Bless the sunlight
Grab this day to make you over
Save the bullet
Price the sandman's head
This time do not roll over
Beat your wings
Yeah, hear them sing
Of up there in the glimpse of silence
Up there
When the days have come to pass
Our journey broken, gone at last
We'll beat our wings
Shadows take familiar skin
So recognize them, don't give in
We'll beat our wings
We will rise again
And ride a perfect high
And find a sweet seed growing
And never know why
We feel anything
Yeah, anything
Yeah, beat your wings
Oh, beat your wings
Yeah, beat your wings
Now beat your wings
Yeah, beat your wings
Yeah, beat your wings
Yeah, beat your wings
Yeah, beat your wings
Yeah, beat your wings
Yeah, beat your wings
Now and then it's a way out life
Yes indeed, it's a strange effect
A couple of brothers with a jar full of oil
Said, "Grab it quick before it spoil."
What about it?
What about it?
What about it?
What about it?
Time is money if not well spent
Ain't no doubt it takes practice
To reprogram that static jive
And fly away like Grandfather Five
What about it?
What about it?
What about it?
What about it?
What about it?
(We're finding time for wasting time)
What about it?
(We're finding time for wasting time)
What about it?
(We're finding time for wasting time)
(We're finding time for wasting time)
I see them in the dark
Fairy wings are green
Chemical minx disguises
Significant pink UFO
I'm not up there
Approach me now
We hope these cables will serve you well
We hold these truths and they're not to sell
I'm not up there
Approach me now
Wrecking now
I could say no way
But she's calling out my vice
Wrecking now
And so I'm through with you
She's bleeding now
She's receiving now
She's defeating now - wrecking
Wrecking now
Turning on all the boys
And the boys have lost
Their heads
Wrecking now
And so I'm through with you
She's bleeding now
She's receiving now
She's defeating now - wrecking
She's wrecking - wrecking
She's wrecking
Even when you're lifted by the lie
Heaven sent and gifted-ask them why
Never give it all up-never try
All their hearts are breaking
Unspirited
The less than life you live
The lessons make you lame, boy
The same, boy
Everywhere that you go, I'm with you now
When you lose it all, you'll think of me
When you take the fall, you'll drink to me
I'm the one who did it painlessly
I'm the one that does it
Unspirited
The less than life you live
The lessons make you lame, boy
The same, boy
Everywhere that you go, I'm with you now
I played the part
I played the start
I made a table out of clay
I placed my hands
Upon the plans
I waited for a proud display
I played around
I heard the sound
Of certain trouble on the way
I got bulldog skin
I got bulldog skin
I took a car
I drove it far
I dug the quality of steel
I crashed my nerve
I made it swerve
I made it back, was no big deal
I tasted blood
A date with scud
And now I don't know how to feel
'Cause I got bulldog skin
I got bulldog skin
All right, get wild
I got bulldog skin
I got bulldog skin
I got bulldog skin
I got bulldog skin
Jayhawk and crocus
Extremely out of focus
Leaves the purple blues
On peeling wallpaper
Try to smell the colour
The vain snappings of a most eloquent speaker
Can be a catalyst
To a great many money-making schemes
Do remember this, undecided college majors
I will ripple in the night sky
Like a bedsheet flapping in the wind
And watch their ghosts pass stigma'd by one another
Never thinking, considering
And behold they do not notice, but I will
Her isolation drills
I promise
It will make me work harder
It will make me work harder
It will make me work harder
And behold they do not notice, but I will
Her isolation drills
(last 3 lines sung over each other as song fades)
"And just when it appears there's going to be a successful campaign against smut, just when the Supreme Court seems to be ruling against pornography, when it appears the nation is returning to old-fashioned moral standards, suddenly the floodgates are going to swing open and Satan is going to vomit filth out of Hell, and it'll be just as it was in the days of Lot, and will vex the souls of God's most devoted, devout saints."

Are you happy, happy today?
Is your face, facemask on?
For the air is thick
And the clouds are moving so slowly
There's a book of instructions
To the rusty time machine
That goes to there, but really nowhere
I wish I could give a shit, just a little bit
What's the difference?
Hey lethargy
Lethargy
Lethargy
Lethargy
Lethargy

We are moving out to meet the others
They are always happy when they see you
Making time like on the spot we borders (?)
You can talk to them by speaking
You can keep the truth from leaking
That sounds weird ??? and ??? for coming
But you haven't asked the right question
Is this ??? breeding
Steel-headed giants roam the land
And feed on chocolate syrup
It's food for the gods
A warning to all pirates
And Jimmy was a fly
Got sucked in by and actor
And wrapped in a cocoon
And skin-tight buffonery
Now here's the plan
Now here's the plan
They're going to spit his body
Across the land
And he'll wind up in a fallen sand
You been poisoned Mr. Suit
Full of fluid
And 37 million bears worth of bad oxygen
No stones in the hand
No birds in the bush
You've been poisoned Uncle Al
By the dealy injection

I challenge you to rock
I challenge you to proper drinking
My challenge will entice
A readjustment of your thinking
Either one
Half or full
Either brother
Rock or roll
Your pallor is not shock
Each hour is your father sinking
And coming home from shop
Whilst wrestling with the perfect stinking
Either one
Half or full
Either brother
Rock or roll

A thoroughbred party
Madly they bite at the

Don't preach, reach!
You know God loves you when you try
Of the same blood that stirs
Making men mean
Wake up fresh
And take a rake
Give up the blues
Let's build something less fake
Find deep within your memory coat
A cricket bag you ate from
Its sweet smiling apology
Acceptance awaits you
Don't be afraid to cherish it
Look it up in the bookmobile
Look it up in the gun rack
In the magazine rack
And the map
For it is only after the fence comes down
That the cartoon bubble explodes
And the new party begins
Invitation only, still in a senator's suitcase
Let them out and dance for the ant god
Like scary magnets to pounce upon command
Upon the man

Comb your silken hair now
You wanna stay young

Buy you pretty lace, yeah
And makeup for your face, yeah
You wanna stay young

All of these girls are a lot like you
Cry indigo tears
And fall on your knees to the fountain of youth
In her social grace now
Gaining so much praise now
You wanna stay young
You wanna stay young
Pills and beauty creams, yeah
Protect a little girl's dreams, yeah
You wanna stay young
You wanna stay young
I hope you know that
All of these girls are a lot like you
Cry indigo tears
And fall on your knees to the fountain of youth
I hope you know that
All of these girls are a lot like you

Time is gone out
If you pick up the weekend
Precisely, do you see
The weak ones of a shifting ethic
Are packing up?
So let me know if you go
Much better Mr. Buckles
The kind nod of his employment
Wishes you well
Let me know if you go
Much better Mr. Buckles
The kind nod of his employment
Wishes you well
Slow and unsure
Do unfurl your lips and call me
Entice me, have a drink
The sick list of a cryptic print

So let me know if you go
Much better Mr. Buckles
The kind nod of his employment
Wishes you well
Let me know if you go
Much better Mr. Buckles
The kind nod of his employment
Wishes you well
Dream on, child of change
Throw your javelin through the sun
Pierce the heart of everyone

This is not reality
This is just formality
The cup is only being filled

Sailing just like the days
Flowing just like the days

Good advice never took you to the way it used to be
And if you can't stay long, well then, you better contact me
You're gonna be confronted by the eye of the storm
It's gonna sneak up behind and grab you by the horns
And on the day you were born
There was a push and shove
For the house of love
That was a long time ago
I think it's almost different, you know
Hey, on the street where we lived
In the land that we knew
You couldn't be so obsolete now
You have better things to do
I'm gonna ram my head on up and back
I'm gonna lay down on a railroad track
I'm gonna find out where I'm coming from
I'm gonna roll up like a big red thumb

The yellow moon looks down now
It lights the scene for the night ahead
Around the chairs in a circle
And I just can't sit down
But the creep stares on
Puts on his glasses and he smokes it down
And that don't matter for much now
He says, "I'm gonna put your head on
And don't you screw it up"
The message was delivered
The mothers wept uncontrollably
Mad children fled to the warehouse
And heavens trumpets blow, yeah
But the creep stares on
Puts on his glasses and he smokes it down
And that don't matter for much, dear
He says, "I'm gonna put your head on
And don't you screw it up"
But the creep stares on
Puts on his glasses and he smokes it down
And that don't matter for much now, dear
He says, "I'm gonna put your head on
And don't you screw it up"

Blessed is the way to a man's heart
Quite so even out of dreadlock
But the bastard of an ex-warhorse kicks
And I smiled like an electric child
(A sign reading: Welcome To New Limited Dimensions)
I leap toward the south yeah
And attempt to burn my bridges
Way down to the equator
And back up north with the wind
I'm travelin'
And the last I heard twelve sad stories
From disciples of the sun
And we rang the bell
And fired the gun
To worship the perfect and sometimes cruel
Impartiality of the sun

"But it gets to be a drag"

Door number four is closed
Running the leg and supporting the arm

I crept from a soft dimension
When one of my souls was lighter
And landed painfully
Into my big chance suit
But I didn't really need it
To stay awake
'Cause this is not my day
And nobody really cares
Anymore anyhow
And nobody called again
'Cause they say that I'm too lazy
To stay alive
Every day it's another world
With every change of tomorrow
Hung over and hungry to fix it
A miracle cure for my sorrow
With pillows of self-esteem
Alone in a satellite dream
Where I can't forget about a world
Where every beam I choose
Is shining alone on you
Shining alone on you, yeah
Every day it's another world
With every change of tomorrow
Hung over and hungry to fix it
A miracle cure for my sorrow
With pillows of self-esteem
Alone in a satellite dream
Where I can't forget about a world
Where every beam I choose
Is shining alone on you
Shining alone on you, yeah
Shining alone on you
Heal this, unblind my eye
He said he's dancing
He said he's dancing
Freed wings and unbridled long strides
He said he's dancing
He said he's dancing
"See us", he said these words
I was talking about your past
Cause I live in the future
For dancing
For dancing
Jupiter spin and voodoo cry
He said he's dancing
He said he's dancing
Feel the moon, watch stars collide
He said he's dancing
He said he's dancing
"Believe us", he said those words
As I'm talking about your past
And I live for the future
For dancing
This is what he said
For dancing
His world his world
Shaping nice
His world his world
Shaping nice
Make them go 'way
They seem so low
They seem so low
Make them go 'way
There and always shopping
Never think to stopping us
When they meet us down the road
Frequently for squeezing
Anything to pleasing them
When they trap us in our homes
Down the road
You tear your childhood down from the cheekbone
You sell me down when you tell me you'll never
Spend days unphased not to tell me "I love you"
And they might not be failing solo
And they might not be playing for the team
What team?
And so they're moving out in circles
To know themselves in life and pleasant dreams
Whose dreams?
Baby don't go
We'll miss you so much
This is your home
Baby don't go
"Wished I was a giant" said "Man get off the street!"
Spoken like a traffic cop, cronies at his feet
Turned on his radio and picked up the noise
Age rules with reason and who's to disagree?
Not Mr. Spit with his abrupt delivery
And Mr. Intelligent is just a wannabe like me
And who makes the breakfast
And who gasses the truck?
The same little bee that stung the bull
And caused the bull to buck
Only a matter of time before we have to pay
If you were 10 years younger and I was a sunbeam
"Wished I Was A Giant" said "Man, it's just a dream"
Only a matter of time before we have to pay
We have to pay
Wooh, wooh
Oh, oh
Wooh
Wooh
Wooh
Can't hear the revolution
Can't hear the revolution
God rolls the sun as he walks down the highway
I have kissed you, you will leave
And the friction in the morning
The friction 'round suppertime
Can't hear the revolution
Can't hear the revolution
See the meaning of driving
And the driver insists
That you buckle up
Wild joy of traffic
And flashing metal interaction
And the mounting commotion
Could the driver resist
Selecting "simply no"
For last legs standing
Autoerotic satisfaction?
This is car language
Turned on by a signal
And everywhere we go
We do it fast
By automobile
This is car language
Turned on by a signal
And everywhere we go
We do it fast
By automobile
By automobile
Pagan shutters described at shrine
Dark stems large elephantine
Serpent seasnake zebra
Up love and deliver your good speech
Of youth and perfect skin
Skygazing free of sin
Clipped at the hip peglegged and cracked
Expressing trivial concern
And then I long 
I'm the frequent weaver who burns
Shaft birth pride of pity
Going back from country to city
Come home now to surround you
You've no more to learn
Who do you think you are?
I'm the frequent weaver who burns
It wants to live but it can't go on
It needs to die but its never been born
Yeah but it all boils down to yourself
All in place it
Billy Wire, Billy gadget
Miles on the faces
Of the task force
Lays the grids, open my lids
Humble thyself to the King of the KIds
You want to flip but he don't know how
They're poking fun at a five-legged cow
Yeah but it all works out for the best
Solemn places
Billy Wire, Billy catch it
Miles on the faces
Of the task force
Lays the grids, open my lids
Humble thyself to the King of the KIds
Slave for greatly wanted drum
Cradle complacently one you don't come
Only a bottle could punt you and moan...
And it's a mug with a smiling face
Plastic flowers in a broken vase
To when he failed the surgery test
They walked across the strip to the kittycats' clutch
I'm in love with a girl named Satellite
And I know that she'll take me home tonight
They're very cute - so select them quickly
Perhaps one day you'll strike a hotter match
I'm in love with a girl named Edison
And her sweetness is my only medicine
Satellite
Goin right
Bop a bop bop bop....
Every street is dark and folding
Out mysteriously
Where lies the chance we take
To be always working, reaching out for
A hand that we can't see
Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me
Invitiation to the last dance
Then it's time to leave
But that's the price we pay
When we deceive one another, animal mother
She opens up for free
Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me
Look at the talkbox
In mute frustration
At the station
There hides the cowboy
Look at the talkbox
In mute frustration
At the station
There hides the cowboy
His campfire flickering
On the landscape
That nothing grows on
But time still goes on
Through each life of misery
Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me
Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me
Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me
Reinvented nightly
Wake up with skills like this
And do you want me in your head?
But what's behind your scattered eyesigns?
I want to reinvent you now
Fifty hats and bargain suits
We will wear them if we must
But who would be a human boot
To kick the wave of current hotlines?
I want to reinvent you now
I want to reinvent you now
Reinvent you nightly
Reinvite you rightly
I'll reunite you
Come on
Reinvented nightly
Wake up with skills like this
And do you want me in your head?
But what's behind your scattered eyesigns?
I want to reinvent you now
I want to reinvent you now
I want to reinvent you now
I want to reinvent you now
I resign myself to the resource
That is, unless I can't go out
Should I concede?
Sell yourself to the man
Feel my good hand
And she flees pell-mell
So sick to have been
Sometimes her mother will work with her
But There's nothing wrong with her
There's nothing wrong with her
There's nothing wrong
So such is life that it writes itself
Trying to right itself
But There's nothing wrong with it
There's nothing wrong
And every single day without much to say
These apparitions raise a toast to their kind
The people who are these things
Are not afraid with you
And caring must go with the wisdom
Of their selections
Never can touch their sign language
So is the cost of sound barriers
Even as though she's still searching
For a cloud with a silver lining
We pray for her
She's burning slow
Out on a mission's light
Christian animation torch carriers
This is a shallow hole but faith makes it safe
Hiding inside a grave with no sound
No witness to see
With or without you
Christian animation torch carriers
However will you learn their sign language
However will you try to hide
Within their eyes?
Within them in life?
Don't make promises you can't keep
I've been hearing that in my sleep
Think of positive things to feel
You feel your strategies are too real
Times I'm thinking about watching me run
Times I'm thinking about I'm okay
Times I'm thinking about I'm going to turn gray
Times I'm thinking about turning your back
And run, wheels in motion
Watch them burn
Please go away now
But do return
Where the eagles
They look at you
When the fire spreads
????
Don't wanna divvy up what we found
I'm territorial holy bound
Times I'm thinking about before we go
Times I'm thinking about long and slow
So run, break the filth up
All around
Slowly build up
And break it down
Find the younger
And knock on wood
They be big now
We feel good
Wheels in motion
Watch them burn
Please go away now
But do return
Droves of growers rolling by
In the trees and way below
Simple factors foiling time
Never did we seem to know
She was high and I was low
Sitting in our bungalow
Eating something wonderful
Never, ever getting full
Nests of crows are hoarding coins
In the competition zone
Hush now seedling, don't you cry
Maybe I'll be coming home quite soon for you
Quite sinful you
Quite soon for you
Quite sinful you
Quite soon for you (Hush now seedling, don't you cry)
Quite sinful you (Maybe I'll be coming home)
Quite soon for you (Hush now seedling, don't you cry)
Militant babies came to me
And told me, "Don't be afraid to try"
Phenomenal stunt kids in the streets
Popping out of the black ghost pie
Fearless ones, cracked up Jack and Jill
They're down there in the bunker still
You look like a sniper anyway
I'm not behind the fighter jet
I'd much rather back a simple girl
I've seen your plan and it's all wet
A noseload of prophecies coming to me
Caught in the trap where bravery steps
A wounded mercenary bleeds
In the hall of fantastically fine things
Where the path of glory leads
Lately I think it's grown too hard
Coming up with the winning card
But who's gonna beat them in their own backyard?
I'm not behind the fighter jet
I'd much rather back a simple girl
I've seen your plan and it's all wet
A noseload of prophecies coming to me
Generous samples rising in the Indian heaven
Doesn't pretend she even cares things change at eleven
She's running off with the fun city girls
She's running off with the fun city girls
She threw away her treasure chest of nice tomorrows
And anyway its such a glue to loosen
Every time you drink it
Doesen't have to think it
She's full grown
Doesn't ever acknowledge ever knowing sound security
Shunning advice and clearly showing new found maturity
She's running off with the fun city girls
She's running off with the fun city girls
She threw away her treasure chest of nice tomorrows
And anyway its such a glue to loosen
Every time you drink it
Doesen't have to think it
She's full grown
With a pocket full of dimestore ammunition
She's arrived at the grand fitting of her mink
And new electric press kit
Maximize the gaping hole and go
This time the world did
What it told me it would
You saw the balloons
You were there
Do you recall the look on the faces
Of all the exhibitors
From 50 or more places
It was a look
That has driven me
From the parade
Left me alone stinking and unafraid
It
Who no longer can listen
It
Saw a gusty wind
Come up to listen
Before I was ten
And all of the evil grids
From a hill where rats consider
And they gang
And they topple
And they send a smoke ring
Into the onion field
A ghost!
And this can make you choke
Coming from the throat
Of a ghost!
And sent to my weak knees
From a voice plantation
All in together
In terror
We've been burned out
Concerned out
Discerned out
We've been sought out
'Cause we can't believe our eyes
We are the willing supporters
And we'd like to know
Why everything is so unkind
We've been sent in
Defending the one thing
'Cause it's our duty
We've got to find out why
We are the willing supporters
And we'd like to know
Why everything is so unkind
We really should be fine, yeah
As the icy breeze is shattered
By speaking to us warmly
To the nation of duress
And God yes, it's a mess
We know this and that
The romantic soul for us
In the lost hierarchy of land
And landowners
And down will go back up forevermore
I must try to believe this
And if I may consider
To look out from an opening
Of freshly painted lines
And letter perfect designs
For we know this and that
The romantic soul for us
In the lost hierarchy of land
And landowners
And down will go back up forevermore
I must try to believe this
Combustion man, yeah, that's where we live
We're starving for the season
Jonesin' for a reason
Isn't it interesting?
Isn't it odd?
Picked to finish last
I will speed my way past
Like a psychodrama
Like a skeleton man
Know the importance
Of timing your ideas
Don't "turn off"
Toy with the options
Get to the point
Pass information
Don't be afraid
"Arrow to bullseye"
Oceans of programs
In a very useful age
More ways of getting
Your ideas across
Not every voice
Needs to be heard
Noble experiments
Spark positive reactions
Blimps go 90, on with the show
Couldn't you see that?
Now, didn't you know?
Aerosol halos --- films of the flag
Rifle games for seven year-olds
What a drag
Yeah now, that's a drag
This is not a vacation
There is no place to go
Weep, sad freaks of the nation
Where blimps go 90
And you can't find me
Senators sipping on Gentleman Jack
"Go, boy," they told me, "So don't you look back."
But don't you worry
I promise to not
I'll join your canary court
And fit into the slot
Say now, what have you got?
Oftentimes, I'm reminded
Of the sweet young days
When I poured punch for the franchise
And thus was knighted
Got so excited
Blimps go 90, on with the show
Couldn't you see that?
Now, didn't you know?
Hey now, didn't you know?
He found a clue
A lovely thing to do
So ram it down his throat
And by and by he will grow
He will grow
Shape me up
Find me the way
The fire spreads around
Have mercy
I know
I live in this kingdom
Alive in this kingdom now
Pike fly mighty, every thing tries to
In the uphill crick
Kings and queens the same-fan that flame, and
Hot soup boils in the wretched spoils of the clock collector's clique
Why should I listen to you
Why should I listen to you now
Cause you're okay
You make me high
And it's a day away oh yeah
Give me strength
Blow some life into me Jesus yeah
You're alright
Blow some life into a free man now
Miracles bleed through steel and needle
In the uphill crick
Silhouettes and screams
That's what we mean
Come on big seven
Gimmie green heaven at the final gun
Why should I listen to you
Why should I listen to you now
Cause you're okay
You make me high
And it's a day away oh yeah
Give me strength
Blow some life into me Jesus yeah
You're alright
Blow some life into a free man now
You're alright
Blow some life into me Jesus yeah
Gimmie strength
Blow some life into a free man now
You're okay
Blow some life into me Jesus now
You're alright
Blow some life into a free man yeah
You're alright
Blow some life into me Jesus now
Gimmie strength
Blow some life into a free man now
You're okay
Blow some life into me Jesus now
You're okay.....
This is called "the coming of age"
Coming into town with the giggling faggots
Starting blizzards and other weird weather patterns
We participate in the shit
Now that's a hit
Now that's a hit!
Hey why don't we all just dive in to statistics river?
Come on, yeah come on, yeah come on yeah
It sweeps along to where shitheads forget
Come on, yeah come on, yeah come on yeah
And the deal is closed
The celebration served
Bank accounts will grow
On with the show
On with the show!
Come on, yeah come on, yeah come on yeah...
Enter he with paperweight - a kinky old man named Jane-Be-Late
He says "Son don't drag me drag me down down to the ground"
Now when he works he blazes trails
Of fine-tooth combs and ponytails
Roll of the dice
Kick in the head
And now you're dead
Open the flume
Cracking the gong
And now you're gone
I cannot hear you gone
In the middle of the night
I cannot hear you gone
In the middle of the night
Something isn't right
Roll of the dice
Roll of the dice
Roll of the dice
Roll of the dice
And now it's nice
Roll of the dice
One, two, three, four
Another one's dying
Travels faster through the hair
Look into the eyes
It travels faster through thin hair
It travels faster through thin hair
Vanishes home
Through thin hair
Another one
The other one
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh
I wince when you map out
How to get it together
And collect my troubles
And brave the weather
Unlocking a freak bag
Of stolen images
An organized zoo
And earthquake glue
A challenge
What to go for and celebrate
With the stock market tumbling
And the rock market crumbling
So where am I now?
For I am a soldier
A trophy mule
I wince when you map out
How to get it together
And collect my troubles
And brave the weather
Crutch came slinking 'round my house last night
Told me to get up
And ready to fight
Little did he know I was happy with you
Little did he show
Now I'm going all the way
Hey hey
Now I'm thinking maybe i should leave
Crawling backwards into to my coat sleeve
Little did we say but I would pack you up and leave
Little did we know the woes
But it's ok and and it's all wrong and so I stay
And now I know ? your not leaving to soon
Grab you you dreams and caste your cash away
Bring you hopes, heres hoping you will stay
I'm not angry now 'cause I'm not worried
Guru me baby
Saw us so he motioned us across
Knew us so he motioned us across
I love you
But that won't get you very far
Guru me baby
I'll be with you
Don't matter where you are
Guru me baby
That won't get you very far
Guru me baby...
Jagged purple rocks
Drunk with the tours and the travel guides
We've all come to Hope Cove
Singing the ??waning?? pop standard
In the haven of our love
Trying to break even
Most of us will not turn back
Somehow I know you will not
Carry all the ancient medicine
Steal my rosy red invention
Gather the amps
And dampen the camps
The day is done
When we see the sun
Perhaps then the race is won
Climbing up to greet you
And all the suns that shine above you
Pretty bombs will sing you
To sleep and you will dream of them
Out of one chance
Out of wonder
A secret box where hides it
They put their hearts inside it
No one has the keys
And so they lie to you
Loving arms attack you
With promises for when you check out
Are they so intrigued
By far off places over there
From inside their pretty cages
They creep out and up the hill
To follow them
Going places
All the same
Peeled in grace before the sunlight
Stripped of face and so the morning...
Hamilton lobby
In the subway naked
I know you're lost
Too bad he answered
Your ripening diamonds
Are gone
Save the company
For one last Sunday
She's nearly dead and buried
But let's dig her up tonight
So endlessly rescue
And may wish to run
To the gold for your teeth
It's great to be proud
To a thicker applause
Shall we meet
To save the company...
He who controls the past
Is coming up soon from the rear
We're waiting to hear from you
To save the company...
You're flying like a fly
In a sky blue sky
You'll be important to the important people
When you die
And I'll settle for a medal
Johnny Appleseed
You're so cherry
You're so cherry
You're so cherry
You're so cherry
You're a breath of insulation
In my draftic attic brain
You're sweeter than the sweet
Cream ladies buzzed on sugar cane
And so the vultures are migrating
To a nastier migraine
You're so cherry
You're so cherry
You're so cherry
You're so cherry
You're so cherry
You're so cherry
You're so cherry
You're so cherry
I'm first lieutenant to you I am
Johnny Appleseed
You're so cherry
You're so cherry
You're so cherry
You're so cherry
I'm first lieutenant to you I am
Johnny Appleseed
Etc...
Days into weeks
She rattled my mind
We stayed out all week
And got happy this time
She fills empty space
I kinda need it that way
Crybaby says bye to me
I can't imagine that all our troubles will go away
But I could catch her and break the falls
I could snatch her with beaks and claws
Today when every "fake it" decides to make it
They just can't take it away
Shove it, 'cause I'll just stay
Like an ugly unwanted stray
Don't care what you say
Do you see me, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Like I see you? Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Do you see me, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Like I see you? Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Do you see me?
Time lost, can't ever understand
The lines like most, we wants to be alone
But we can't be alone
Do you see me, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Like I see you? Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Do you see me, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Like I see you? Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Do you see me?
Can't believe the things we ask for
Can't believe the things we want
Do you see more than I do?
Do you see me?
Do you see more than I do?
Do you see me, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Do you see me?
Do you see me, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Do you see me?
Do you see more than I do?
Do you see more than I do?
Do you see more than I do?
Every street is dark and folding
Out mysteriously
Where lies the chance we take
To be always working, reaching out for
A hand that we can't see
Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me
Invitiation to the last dance
Then it's time to leave
But that's the price we pay
When we deceive one another, animal mother
She opens up for free
Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me
Look at the talkbox
In mute frustration
At the station
There hides the cowboy
Look at the talkbox
In mute frustration
At the station
There hides the cowboy
His campfire flickering
On the landscape
That nothing grows on
But time still goes on
Through each life of misery
Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me
Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me
Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me
Sister, I need wine
For color in my skin
And darkness for my eyes
But I can see the light burn through
Still it is the night brings me to you
Sister, use your gift
The backed up river spreads
On ground for fighting words
And I am hating the ignorance in my body
And I can't feed on the heaviness
Sister, I need you
And we will dance for gold
And straddle the hour of fear
And learn the real story
Drink the truth
Shed not one tear
On the tundra
We went under
We're going under now
On the tundra
We went to vicious places
Of dark and punished faces
Couldn't shake it
Or outgrow it
Swung hell's gate open now
Don't we know it
'Cause with my second guessing
The subjects for the testing
Look over our blunders
Our two-fisted wonders
The foxy wildest monster's dial is
More peaceful than a human hammer
The great pretend transmissionaries
Evolving without you
Dissolving without you
As you know
It's just too slow on the tundra
And then one day
Maybe today
We'll justify the joke
Make it our day
And blow the total savings
To satisfy our cravings
Look over our blunders
Our two-fisted wonders
The foxy wildest monster's dial is
More peaceful than a human hammer
The great pretend transmissionaries
Evolving about you
Dissolving without you
As you know
It's just too slow
As you know
Evolving about you
Dissolving without you
As you know
Evolving about you
Dissolving without you
As you know
Evolving about you
Dissolving without you
As you know
Oh, she's so on top of things
Gone out but so looking within
She's got her heart pressed to the ground
To extend her knowledge
And I'll spend my life with her now
She dreams of sleeping now
And how she can take me inside
And now it's warm and cold
All around
Be on top of me now
Be on top of me now
She already is
As far from you crying now
The longest day dying now
So I guess some truth belongs to us
In places that tremble and wish
And a citizen of there am I
She comes to play along
Be on top of me now
Be on top of me now
She already is
As far from you crying now
The longest day dying now
Time is slow without you now
I wanna know about you now
It's all in me now
It's all in me now
It's all in me now
Citizen of there am I of
All me now
It's all in me now
It's all in me now
Citizen of there am I
My name is James
James Riot is who I am
I am the rock
Of the fancified world I am
I store the answers of my game
Sharpens my pick and cramp
I am the bastard
Naked before the bitch
I am the beast
Under wrap on the frazzled spit
Know you ??? mind your mark
I'll see you writhe and twitch
I am up against the wall
????
Courage in the clothes we bought
This is where the next show falls
????????
??????
?????
????
I'll meet you after television
When the instant city bleeds
The old stones will shift
And the brides will tell
Of an empire of grain
That went to the rats
They'll remember well
I've got a thing or two
I wanna give to you again
I see a real baby blue
Not yet glued to you again
Come on down
Emitting dimensions are swallowing you
I picked a room with a view
Under the stars
Good men how do you wait
Like factory ham
On an inchworm train?
Bad men how will you steal
Another good day
With an episode of pain?
I've got a thing or two
I wanna give to you again
I've seen a real baby blue
Not yet glued to you again
Come on down
Emitting dimensions are swallowing you
I picked a room with a view
Under the bushes
Dragging feet animal fat
All over the place
She's an automatic trigger
Son of an animal doctor
Da da da da
I got the fever for a lunch
????
I got the fever for a
Plate full of beaver
Not a ?? in the bunch
Da da da da
She looked up in the noonday sun
Said, "Fighter jets are so unreal."
But we've got a job to be done
Come on
When I was just a boy
I saw the kings of the big gold cities
But as they died, I dried up inside
Let's ride
Let's ride on airplanes and buses
Let's ride to the end of the line
Let's ride on fast motorcycles
Let's leave the routines of living behind
We pulled into a tick-tock town
And all the people looked so happy
Another trip down the elephant slide
Let's ride
Let's ride on subways and steeples
Let's ride to the end of the line
Let's ride on prescriptions and bottles
Let's leave the routines of living behind
Let's ride on airplanes and buses
Let's ride to the end of the line
Let's ride on fast motorcycles (ahhhh)
Let's leave the routines of living behind
Onion lady blows her precious prose
And so it goes
Kisses to the crying cooks
Their bigs in books
With baited hooks
Chorus: And days away from your army
And spend with whimsy kings and slaves
A girl of God becomes a cash flower
A catalog of gardens and graves
Travelers diagram
For where I am
From where I am
Director of visional codes and overloads
It all explodes
Chorus
Secrets and sense, they are calling me in
Skin to skin combat is set to begin
Eyes gazing lasers, exploring like hands
Liken me downward, move, soldier, move now
The skits turn night, the skits turn night
Sleeper to dreamer
Hands drawing me in
White lace lips whisper in full blue again
Riding a taker, prepare for enjoy
White laces whisper in life has been sown
The skits tonight, the skits tonight
The skits tonight, the skits tonight
The skits tonight, the skits tonight
The skits tonight, the skits tonight
Secrets and sins are calling me out
Secrets and sins are calling me out
Secrets and sins are calling me out
Secrets and sins are calling me out
The skits tonight, the skits tonight...
Happy Jack wasn't tall, but he was a man
He lived in the sand at the Isle of Man
The kids would all sing, he would take the wrong key
So they rode on his head in a hurry on Quay
The kids couldn't hurt Jack
They tried and tried and tried
They dropped things on his back
And lied and lied and lied and lied and lied
But they couldn't stop Jack, or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy
But they couldn't stop Jack, or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy
The kids couldn't hurt Jack
They tried and tried and tried
They dropped things on his back
And lied and lied and lied and lied and lied
But they couldn't stop Jack, or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy
(I saw ya!)
These thoughts replace me when I'm on the floor
I cannot taste the sweetness anymore
You bipolarize me with each test
Contaminate the faintest breath
For speaking well of in the name
Of where to watch and who to blame
All of us there
What should I wear?
For human frailty on parade
To entertain you may invade
A silent party, secret wish
At best an unconvincing kiss
Expand
Explode
Wrinkle up
Or blow away
I took you up to let me down
I take the time to track you
Through chosen smokescreen silhouettes
Who've earned the right to back you
This for so long
Perfect and wrong
You write me out, I reappear
To criticize you interfere
But I will say what I want to
And there is nothing you can do
Expand
Explode
Wrinkle up
Or blow away
Direct amphibian lost his attack
Came through so low that could mow you a railroad track
We are having the time of our lives
We are having the time of your lives
Incorrect corinthians step to the rocket
Coming back to the world with cash in his pocket
We are having the time of our lives
We are having the time of your lives
Don't go through the soul of the medicine man
He is calculating and it's all in his plan
For the solid bird boys to replace your fears
Royal right handed down through the years
And as the world goes 'round we can start a new life
'Cause dear Mr. Jesus I need me a wife
We are having the time of our lives
We are having the time of your lives
We are having

I know when it's coming
And it's not a bad thing
You wouldn't hold back
If you wanted to sing
You'd say "hey
Look over there"
June salutes you
With her oncoming glare
Like a chain in a gun
Like a call in the sun
Like a bell or a spell
Like an angel
With stars circling round her head
I wanna be there
For each hopeless affair
Out of bucks and out of blame
But I can do it just the same
We're saying
"Come and intercept our love" (three times)
Lasting forever
For rain and wet weather
Enjoy us employ us
We'll serve it in a time of need
Hey, June salutes you
From the fundamental champs
And Tammy and the Amps
We're singing
"Come and intercept our love" (three times)
Days into weeks
She rattled my mind
We stayed out all week
And got happy this time
She fills empty space
I kinda need it that way
Crybaby says bye to me
I can't imagine that all our troubles will go away
But I could catch her and break the falls
I could snatch her with beaks and claws
Today when every "fake it" decides to make it
They just can't take it away
Shove it, 'cause I'll just stay
Like an ugly unwanted stray
Don't care what you say
It was sure fine to see you
Delicious and thank you for coming
There is nowhere to go but up
You know that for I tell you
All of our friends are thinking about us
The cup is running over
I am hypnotizing the highway
I am baptizing mad rivers
And the rivers run wild
And the highway is long
It was so good to see you
You know that for I tell you
Sopor Joe
You oughta know
How to move fast
How to move slow
Sopor Joe
You oughta see
How to be a slave
And how to be free
Bellyache Sam
Thinks that she am

On that creep

Are you gonna roam
And make it on home?
Make it on home, yeah

Sleep with all the people that you know

Oh he's rollin over
(Oh spider fighter)
Bitter fish in crude oil sea
You don't have to bother me
You just have to join in on this song
Crawling people on your knees
Don't take this so seriously
You just have to hum it all day long
To dine alone
To build a private zone
Or trigger a synapse
And free us from our traps
You won't see me turn my back
With my head against my stack
Spitting teeth and breaking open skin
Official ironmen, you are free
Champions officially
But you won't catch me on an open chin
To dine alone
To build a private zone
Or trigger a synapse
And free us from our traps
Knockout punches for the freaks
Happy little babies with red cheeks
You will rock them gently out of sync
Confirmations through the wire
Spitting gas into the fire
Am I also worthy of a drink?
To dine alone
To build a private zone
Or trigger a synapse
And free us from our traps
Look out at the air raid
Stays thick'd and come alive
Visit this place, now to peace and
Visit this place do you reach out?
Visit this place, not at peace and
Visit this place will you reach it?
Go with the ushers of simple pain
Take chances examine the broken circles
Visit this place, now to peace, yeah
Visit this place do you reach out?
Visit this place, not at peace, yeah
Visit this place if you reach it
Crawl from the holes that hold your eyes
Feel the importance of crying
Visit this place, now to peace, yeah
Visit this place but do you reach out?
Visit this place, not at peace, yeah
Visit this place about to reach it
Visit this place

Oh baby, this is the land of danger
(Each and every home a battlefield)
Oh baby, this is the throat of a stranger
(Searching for the blood that's now congealed)
Oh baby, this is a thick muddy mystery
(Tearing at the pages of our past)
Oh baby, this is the straight path of history
(Human motion, land and ocean)
Try to run
Try to hide
It's been a long, long, long, long, long, long time
It's been a long, long, long, long, long time
Oh baby, this is the fresh flesh of anger
(Calling out for action in the streets)
Oh baby, this is a slow running canker
(Opened up by victories and defeats)
Oh baby, this is the night of the dancer
(Dancing on a time bomb in my head)
Oh baby, this is the ultimate cancer
(Human notion, fear in motion)
Try to run
Try to hide
It's been a long, long, long, long, long, long time
It's been a long, long, long, long, long time

Mother of ??? boots
Good words and perfumes licked my nose
I got to like that

Rocky's summer horse head
Catfood on the earwig
I got to like that
To make me happy
Milk cream cars
Go shopping

Oh, the ?edget?
And then you go
And then you wonder
Exactly why
But you add up one note
I got a egg roll reaction

I got a dead man reaction

Everyone's standing in line
Smell of it making me sick
A pshicical seismic ???
And the walls are like paper and ice
Speak to me revolution boy
Come out to me daughter of joy
I am the collector of things

And tell me the lesson we ???
And lead me to the oxygen tank
And who will be the speaker of the day
And can I exchange my surprise
Speak to me revolution boy
Come out to me daughter of joy

I walked into a place
A living space of total grace
And time without, 'cause I'm tripped out is through
And there's nothing I'd rather do

There's nothing I'd rather do

Mother, feeling your hand I
Believe you and I did then
And mother, release every bad seed
The geese are leaving the trees
Exposed to winter's cold
They waited too long
But we too exaggerated
And I take the cake away
It's a long song
And I can play it so
Give me a pick now
Collector of bones
Words of smoke
Distorted, never broken
Paradise is open but I choke
One of these days when I see through the smoke
There'll be the day I get the joke
Exposed to winter's cold
They waited too long
But we too exaggerated
And I take the cake away
It's a long song
And I can play it so
Give me a pick now
Collector of bones
Words of smoke
Distorted, never broken
Paradise is open but I choke
One of these days when I see through the smoke
There'll be the day I get the joke
Damn good, Mr. Jam
Melted Pat knows where she's at
She's copping a buzz
On something that was
Melted Pat thinks that it's good
And maybe she should
Cause it's always good
She's knocking around
She's always up to knocking around
She's always up to knocking around
She's knocking around
She's knocking around
Melted Pat she's losing her care
She's losing her hair
And now she's not there
Melted Pat she's telling me that
I'm living a lie
I'm wearing a tie
She's going away
She's always up to going away
She's always up to going away
She's going away
She's going away
Does she blend well?
Your choice, I mean
Your angel baby monkey girl
The gift of smiles and love production
Her sunshine mind
Her storm cloud eyes
Blending colors into brown
Confusing emotions, deliberately
Does it hurt you?
To love, I mean
And all the creases in your brow
The red bedspread, the storm vibrations
The starless nights
The shattered screen
Allowing pain to enter
Let your guard/God down, obviously
It will try to find you
No matter where you may go
It will try to find you
No matter who you may know
Does it hurt you?
To love, I mean
Does it hurt you?
To love, I mean
Does it hurt you?
To love, I mean
Pandemonium ensues
Sure enough fire and the dog barks
Let's get acquainted
Been so many days or should I say
"So long"
On the outset jets coming
People tend to take you away
Send me to the grip of funerals
The pain is in each character
Facing it always does
Wake up and pray tell
Where can we get off
Lean one
Double up your fists for the undercut
Pandemonium subsides
Rest assured
No welcome wagons will be there
When I get home
I heard you what the problem is
I didn't hear you both
You're coming through
Like weird electric jive
Bumming your role
I'm playing your role
Will you love me come Saturday?
Yeah I know it's too hard to plan it
And will the attachment stay attached?
Until destroyed by a match
Watch it burn a light in the night
Watch it burn a light in the night
Fire cleanses a soul
Fire cleanses a spirit
But I don't wanna hear it
Through a box with wires
I wanna taste it with my own two eyes
Burn baby burn
Burn baby burn baby burn baby burn
We're watchin' Hank's (watchin' Hank's)
Watchin' Hank's (watchin' Hank's) little fingers

Touching like new skin
Pulling on the fibers within
Hammerbox and strum
Beating on the indian drum

Twilight campfighter
You build your fire into an open wound
You want us to feel better
On these darker trails
With light revealing holy grails
To hike through dangerous weather
You need twilight eyes
Sunspot solider, you come from another day
Accept no pay
You want us to feel better
All for longing causes
Racing minds and lengthy pauses
All who must soon shed their veils
And wipe their eyes
As we vegetate and wait around for brighter days
And can dance contented to the sound of money
Could I have seen a sight
Much greater than your twilight eyes
That penetrate your silent lives (lies)
Twilight campfighter
We do congratulate
It's not too late
To make us all feel better
Under darker skies
With your twilight eyes
Think of a no parking zone
Where armored cars keep the street
And every heart seeks inspiration
It is full to maximum capacity
Leave your things in the streets
And run wild
Wooden heads on the chopping block
And other hearts pumping ink
That spills out over dreams of antiquity
Pale but full of ghostly charm
Leave your things in the streets
And run wild
Every street is dark and folding
Out mysteriously
Where lies the chance we take
To be always working, reaching out for
A hand that we can't see
Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me
Invitiation to the last dance
Then it's time to leave
But that's the price we pay
When we deceive one another, animal mother
She opens up for free
Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me
Look at the talkbox
In mute frustration
At the station
There hides the cowboy
Look at the talkbox
In mute frustration
At the station
There hides the cowboy
His campfire flickering
On the landscape
That nothing grows on
But time still goes on
Through each life of misery
Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me
Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me
Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me
Sip on that fear my (?) one
Suddenly see no change at all
People don't know what's happening
Dream a lot soon much dream won't flow
Shouldn't know mine inside I throw
Can't sure called when the money's gone
Try it all in one, I heard you write, die it all in time
Step on it wheels go rolling home
Stubbornly see no signs at all
Seagulls don't know what they're circling
And I suddenly feel my heroes gone
Suddenly see no change at all
People don't know what is going on
Try it all in one, I heard you write, die it all in time
And now that their field is full of sold
(?) not golden hand or bow
Shall not show, ah-ah-aah
Into my twilight hit won't glow
Shouldn't I choose my own hello
And goodbye, (?) light's calling
Girl from the sun
The color red
She melted my gun
She melted my head
She's got me
Talking to myself
I sit in restaurants
Forever and talk to myself
She's a girl from the sun
And she sings like a parrot
I'm a very nice fellow
She's right for me
And the full-colored kingdom
Of trickery and chaos
I like her tremendously
And to turn those objections
Into (beer without directions?)
I'll fight for the free
And people who live in glass houses should get stoned
Like the girl from the sun and me
My fist did a one arm swing
You would be happy to know
Credit crap sinking on my fish string
You would be happy to know
You would be happy to know it
Came in to town
These are for real
The race is what thrills me
I'm going down to Scorpion Lounge
To find the face that kills me
You would be happy to know
You would be happy to know
You would be happy to know it
Came in to town
These are for real
The race is what thrills me
I'm going down to Scorpion Lounge
To find the face that kills me
Real somethings are real
Find the face that kills me
I'm going down to Scorpion Lounge
To find the face that kills me
I'm going down right through the town
To visit the real that thrills me
I'm going down to Scorpion Lounge
To find the face that kills me
When you're old and gray
I'll still take your hand in mine
Oh my heart is true
My love for you is real
When your bones are frail
I'll still sleep soft at your side
Oh my heart is true
My love for you is real
Bumbling now with nowhere left to go
Charlemagne's creation falling slow
Of an old king's secret files
A jewel box for his nose
Now the guard no fresh king
For the creep who comes and goes
Oh
Wings refer to the wedding cake
The glasses fall and hearts will break
The primal scream is hard to take, you know
Oh
Caught in deep but a shallow spirit he
Called for his gardener and his company
Demo for the tattoo
And the crisis that is today
Common facts about the unknown
Hide them all away
Hey
Wings refer to the wedding cake
The glasses fall and hearts will break
The primal scream is hard to take, you know
Something I grant you have taken
More or less we're somewhat shaken
Make with it more ill-begotten gain
Try and explain
Here's a picture from the house of meat
Are you the person i'm scheduled to meet
To assess my skeleton's worth?
Do the earth
Curtains open and the guests are fried
In my attempt to seem dignified
I re-enact my birth
Do the earth
Do the earth i wanna ramble in opium fields
Playing tricks on the invasion boys
Penetrator like a space invader - do the earth
Do the earth- this tear will never wash away
On any human sanitation day
And i will starve to death and wither away
Unless you feed me
I'm too tired to run from the tiger
I'm too dumb to hide in the bushes
I'm a human costume with veins of gold
I'll face the punching bag - do what i'm told
Til i get old and have to dwell
In the valley of the ironman
Do the earth -- you beckon me and leave it up to fate
You offer salvation and i salivate
And the thought of my next free cheese
Hear the voice
Imagine the emotional lift
Every pressing engagement canceled
And suddenly it's real
I'm going to write it down so I'll remember it
And then pound it out and let it ring
The top chick's silver chord
Embraced released and then ignored
Cold out morning we'll bring the sunny inside
Through the window beams bring in yellow moonshine
Sunny day a move away
With our nets in the corner glowing
With our nets in the corner glowing
With our nets in the corner glowing
With our nets in the corner glowing
Cold out morning we'll bring the sunny inside
Through the window beams bring in yellow moonshine
Sunny day a move away
With our nets in the corner glowing
With our nets in the corner glowing
With our nets in the corner glowing
With our nets in the corner glowing
As I'm waking up the stars I'm wondering
How they might be gleaming, standing on my toes
Rocking on my heels, reaching for the light beans
Oh my soul goes climbing into
Places I could never go, impossible to know
As I'm wondering once more
Children wake, children wake
As I'm reaching for my dreams I'm wondering
How it might be feeling floating towards the ceiling
No gravity too steal, flying over fields
And oh my soul goes around and down, too
Things I'd never see reveal themselves to me
As I'm wondering once more
Children wake, children wake
As I'm waking up the stars I'm wondering
How they might be speeding across the ceiling
As I'm wondering once more
Noticing the change
We are taking time
Everybody knows
Everybody's fine
And we'll figure out
Purpose in the end
Unless we have to jump
Unless we have to win
Hold your tongue
Brace yourself
Give me a kiss
Show me what I missed
Can I find a phone
Can I drop a dime
Can I get a loan
Running out of time
And I'll have a toast
To what it's all about
Unless they move us on
Unless they move us out
Hold your tongue
Brace yourself
Give me a kiss
Show me what I missed
Seven doglegs hung to dry
In the woods that way
Postal blowfish make me cry
It works that way
Begging on the nail don't fail
To clue me in
??Cluster frogs and crabs begin??
Hey, glad girls only want to get you high
And they're alright
There will be no coronation
There will be no flowers flowing
In the light that passes though me
Hey, glad girls only want to get you high
And they're alright
There will be no graduation
There will be no trumpets blowing
In the light that passes through me
With the sinking of the sun
I've come to greet you
Clean your hands and go to sleep
Confess the dreams
Of good and bad men all around
Some are lost
And some have found
The light that passes though me
Chain smoke rings like a vapor snake kiss
She says she don't know why
The closer you are, the quicker it hits you
Closer you are, the quicker it hits you
Now you can see the boys dreaming, scheming
You play the heavy
It's a real slick movie move
Stoned at the Alamo tonight
The closer you are, the quicker it hits you
Try to be nice and look what it gets you
Now you can see the boys dreaming, scheming
I get up at seven o'clock
And drive myself up to the lookout rock
The closer you are, the quicker it hits you
The closer you are, the quicker it hits you
Now you can see the boys dreaming, scheming
The closer you are, the quicker it hits you
The closer you are, the quicker it hits you
The closer you are, the quicker it hits you
Has there been a break today
Stoned comedian ringo?
Should i put the plates away?
Captain, are you sure they're coming in?
I am quail and quasar
I picked you up on radar
I do my job each day
Empties crushed and filed away
And there is nothing worse than
An undetermined person
Can i abuse you please
In my subspace biographies?

The Flying Party
The flying party is here...
They should never take you away
Not with all the little lines you say
Especially when you make them laugh
Come with me, believe in what you're making me
Baby, out of sadness there is pain
But your barrage of little lines is making me
Change now
Change
Philosophers and critics of the play
We're listening hard to every word we say
Especially when it makes us laugh
Come with me, believe in what you're making me
Baby, out of sadness there is pain
But your barrage of little lines is making me

I remember things
We weren't in the plan
Long ago when I was a young man
Never tried to hide
Never really saw the
House that holds
The hawk's head cold
Is mine yes
I drink myself into a drunken mess
Lose my luck, fail the test
They're are the things I wanna say to you
They're are things that I'd like to say to you
Rings of blue and rings of gold
So many stories to be told
It hurts me worse than it hurt you
You realize now that's not true, oh
Amber, neon, wet concrete
A well-worn path, a smothering heat
A curious pet in an open cage
Subjected to his masters rage, oh
A portrait destroyed by fire
A portrait destroyed by fire
A portrait destroyed by fire

Makes no sense to me
Proud men wear it only
Brings good company
How am I so lonely?
So run away
The sun is outside of a world at play
Awaiting the solid gold display
Mysterious engines run
To keep the dream from ending
The cloak obscures the gun
To keep what's worth defending
The best of days
The ones to remember are crumbling now
The vandals come for rummage
Affordable trends in anxiety
Especially the ones that make you raw
Portable men's society
Now I mention, now I mention these things

Climb through society, been while the riot team
They seem to the catch, don't take yourself too much
But come just before me, come just before me
Transform drop for (?) with glass and white affairs
We'll make extensive nights to the city lights now
Come just before me, come just before me
Come just before me, come just before me
Come just before me, come just before me, come just before me
She's got the face
She's got a face that makes me happy
I never thought about how lovely it was
Until one day she went over and out
Over and out
Over and out
When will she come back to me?
Over and out
Wish the lack of mystery if you have a history, alright
Have a jug and you will see your new personality, alright
And in the last you might not know
And forget the songs you taught to sing
And you're bound to reach the point
Where you find yourself exposed
To the ancient crystal mug
Find him when you have a jug
Mental animals are tired
Worn out
Hurt is opposite
To think themselves awake
Drastic religion in peril
Stronger lizards regurgitate
Probable cause
Unless we get out
Now
I dig the way you skim
Light and fried, like creme brulee
Svelt melta, pussyheart
Sweet and unwrinkled
'Neath a thousand pounds of clothes
Expensive ones
The cobra feels like this
Otherwise, yes, of course, we miss
A French coach close up beneath the rear
We're playing guns again, we have no fear
Super balls, they cause the problem hearts
Apples fresh, and screw you in an outer space hypnotic, it's a bite
None of them or all of us will fight
Time is blowing constantly of fit
Lately I've been thinking out of shit
Nervous skin, no humble pack, no fun
Freshly from a coma on the run
Secret stuffs and space inspects itself
Frost collects itself upon the shelf
Audio James never had a chance
Never had a bullet for the dance
We have found
What appears to be the head
Of the operation
Somewhat lighter
And a little smaller
Than expected
But we've not yet found the body
Of the sawed-off head
No, not yet found the head
Oh, to lift me over lines I shall not cross
You can't mean that
If it causes pain @ any cost
You can't mean that
There is
A guide(/guy?)
Who comes around and counts(/pounds?) you
Knows your name
Assigns a descriptive sign
But it's so hard to analyze that sign
Were you perfect this time?

During the initiation
Please refrain from conversation
Leave your opinions at home
Put your cigarettes out
I've been thinking a lot
I might have difficulty
I've lost my insensity
But I'll get over it
Dream on, child of change
Throw your javelin through the sun
Pierce the heart of everyone
Though we push to slave the days
This is not reality
This is just formality
The cup is only being filled
For the chance to have it spilled
Flowing just like the days
Sailing just like the days
Flowing just like the days
Sailing just like the days
Flowing just like the days
Sailing just like the days
Flowing just like the days
Sailing just like the days
Flowing
When the tension was pulling tight
Leave you hanging without a fight
Give it all up 'cause theres no living
In this world of politic
No giving. Are you quitting?
I certainly hope not, oh no
I certainly hope not, oh no
I certainly hope not, oh no, oh oh
There's so many things people say
Just to help, but get in the way
I won't try to figure things out
It's complicated so when in doubt
Start crying? Stop trying?
I certainly hope not, oh no
I certainly hope not, oh no
I certainly hope not, oh no, oh oh
I certainly hope not, oh no
I certainly hope not, oh no
I certainly hope not, oh no, oh oh
Attracted to the light
Where everything will be alright
Attracted to the light
Where everything will be alright
Attracted to the light
Where everything will be alright
Every street is dark and folding
Out mysteriously
Where lies the chance we take
To be always working, reaching out for
A hand that we can't see
Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me
Invitiation to the last dance
Then it's time to leave
But that's the price we pay
When we deceive one another, animal mother
She opens up for free
Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me
Look at the talkbox
In mute frustration
At the station
There hides the cowboy
Look at the talkbox
In mute frustration
At the station
There hides the cowboy
His campfire flickering
On the landscape
That nothing grows on
But time still goes on
Through each life of misery
Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me
Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me
Everybody's gotta hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me
Long road black road touch the road
It's a hard road
Spontaneous combustion
Final decision it's the only way
Straight up off from the aggressive rock
Intelligensia
But I feel no pain
From the vacuum that sucks me in
Chorus: I saw you drifting away
With your car today
With the world rushing by
In the wink of an eye
Move away from the whip
On the reality ship
And the world is a toy
For sensational gravity boy
Words in the important points
Is the assassin
Models just them figurines
Yeah just the ones we chose to keep
Look them over vaguely spacy
He spots them
And he will not change
He is a trooper when it comes to that
Chorus
Sister, I need wine
For color in my skin
And darkness for my eyes
But I can see the light burn through
Still it is the night brings me to you
Sister, use your gift
The backed up river spreads
On ground for fighting words
And I am hating the ignorance in my body
And I can't feed on the heaviness
Sister, I need you
And we will dance for gold
And straddle the hour of fear
And learn the real story
Drink the truth
Shed not one tear
Captain's dead
The war machine has fled
The people have gone home
Remember what he said
And you won't feel alone
You won't remember at this time tomorrow
When all the sorrow has gone
A pull of the lever and nothing's forever
We'll ride to the heart of the sun
Captain's dead
The war machine has fled
The people have gone home
Remember what he said
And you won't feel alone
You won't remember at this time tomorrow
When all the sorrow has gone
A pull of the lever and nothing's forever
We'll ride to the heart of the sun
Captain's dead
Captain's dead
Captain's dead
Captain's dead
Isn't it great to exist
At this point in time?
Where the produce is rotten
But no one is forgotten
On strawberry Philadelphia Drive
Children in the sprinkler
Junkies on the corner
The smell of fried foods
And pure hot tar
Man, you needn't travel far
To feel completely alive
On strawberry Philadelphia Drive
On a hazy day in 19 something and 5
Look to the outside
In the failing garden
In the backwash
Far-out crops
Single-minded erections
Not so observable
From the inside
You must listen
You must look
In a soft-shelled vehicle
Gaze through this book
See them!
In a closet of household items
In a forest of examples
And i'm taking samples
Clipping and saving
Far-out crops
With surgical focus
She stared at me and said
"I'm willing to reach out into your head
And I will keep you and cleanse you"
She glared at me and wept
A change is not going to hurt you
Not this time
And I've been waiting in line for this
Now that it's taken forever, I insist
Until I get it, I can't breathe
Climbing high upon the rocky cliffs, she flies
With surgical focus
With surgical focus
With surgical focus
She stared at me and said
"I'm willing to reach out, get into your head
And I will keep you and cleanse you"
She glared at me and wept
A change is not going to hurt you
Not this time
And I've been waiting in line for this
Now that it's taken forever, I insist
Until I get it, I can't breathe
Climbing high upon the rocky cliffs, she flies
With surgical focus
With surgical focus
Well, I've been waiting in line for this
Now that it's taken forever, I insist
Until I get it, I can't breathe
Climbing high upon the rocky cliffs, she flies
With surgical focus
With surgical focus
With surgical focus
With surgical focus
With surgical focus
With surgical focus
Traveller's diagram
For where I am, for what I am
Check the provisional codes
It overloads, it all explodes
And hey, let's throw the great party
Today for the rest of our lives
The fun is just about to get started
So throw the switch, it's rock and roll time
Special elixirs flow
And then the onion lady blows
Kisses to the crying cooks
With baited hooks and lady looks
And hey, let's throw the great party
Today for the rest of our lives
The fun is just about to get started
So throw the switch, it's rock and roll time
You must be willing just to ride along with me
You must be happy just to do the job for free
Yours for the taking if you follow simple rules
Such acts of subservience were never taught in schools
Spit me out from your cosmos
Draft me into your troops
Set me up for the knockdown
You can watch, come watch
And I'll be back when it's over
I'm much greater than you think
I'm a swimmer in the drink
I'm much greater than you think
I'm a swimmer in the drink
And oh, mesh gear fox
Put out another bag of tricks from scientific box
Time's wasting and you're not gonna live forever
And if you do
I'll come back and marry you
No use changing now, you couldn't anyhow and ever
It's not the way that I feel, that I feel
It's the way you act
It's the way you look when you're near me
It's not so hard to conceal, to conceal
It's the things you say
It's the things you do, go right through me
Long Live Rockathon
Offspring and Tag alongs were finding
The history book has lost its binding
Pages everywhere
Two Titans without care will read them
We conjure ghosts and then we feed them
And if it all goes well we'll laugh a lot
And then take photographs
Of what we made, lemonade
Freedomcake quick to bake
Trim the tree collectively
Breath the air from the fair
And watch colored lights shine down
Dancing round the lady's face
As we learned the sound
We can't keep this violent pace
Though we know that haste makes waste
And I'm giving you a ring
For the dreams of the weed king we all sing
Traveller's diagram

I crept from a soft dimension
When one of my souls was lighter
And landed painfully
Into my big chance suit
But I didn't really need it
To stay awake
'Cause this is not my day
And nobody really cares
Anymore anyhow
And nobody called again
'Cause they say that I'm too lazy
To stay alive
Every day it's another world
With every change of tomorrow
Hung over and hungry to fix it
A miracle cure for my sorrow
With pillows of self-esteem
Alone in a satellite dream
Where I can't forget about a world
Where every beam I choose
Is shining alone on you
Shining alone on you, yeah
Every day it's another world
With every change of tomorrow
Hung over and hungry to fix it
A miracle cure for my sorrow
With pillows of self-esteem
Alone in a satellite dream
Where I can't forget about a world
Where every beam I choose
Is shining alone on you
Shining alone on you, yeah
Shining alone on you
Dream on, child of change
Throw your javelin through the sun
Pierce the heart of everyone
Though we push to slave the days
This is not reality
This is just formality
The cup is only being filled
For the chance to have it spilled
Flowing just like the days
Sailing just like the days
I'd like to see you break the spell
He hits and runs
Blows worlds apart
And from the start
It worked so well
So please pray tell
Why is it equally difficult
A double back somersault
I'm getting on, better get off
Psycho bird gets loud
Throws up onto the crowd
Seperate three-eyed brown men survive
Especially these eyes will crown him
Someone tell me why I do the things
That I don't want to do
When you're around me I'm somebody else
Someone tell me why I act like a fool
When things don't go my way
When you're around me I'm somebody else
There is good reason I guess
For having at once gone too far
When you clean out the hive
Does it make you want to cry?
Are you still being followed
By the teenage FBI?
Someone tell me why
Someone tell me why
Someone tell me why I do the things
That I don't wanna do
When you're around me I'm somebody else
Someone tell me why
Someone tell me why
Someone tell me why
Circus day holdout
Spoiling the show
Circus day holdout
Guessing the weight
Circus day holdout
Says life isn't fair
But let the guys know
Tell them I care
Crank up your monkey
And organ without me
Circus day holdout
Says life isn't fair
But let the guys know
Tell them I care
Crank up your monkey

Crank up your monkey
And organ without me
Crank up your monkey

Orbital ghosts
Attract sparks
Aftermath heaven
The unborn called
They miss you
The stones are dead
With different fathers
The vulgar souls
Equal in torture
Fly
Torn apart
Come back to me
My zodiac companion
Come back to me
Come back to me
Umbrella swords
With which we play fight
Sixes and sevens
Saucers and cups
For Magdalene
A nebulous wish
An apparatus
For cleaning our pipes and pans
All space for breakfast
Cleared
When can we start
Come back to me
My zodiac companion
Come back to me
My zodiac companion
Come back to me
My zodiac companion
Come back to me
Come back to me
Kid on a ladder
Letting sunlight in
In his phone
You might know him
If you do
What would it matter?
If he lights a lighter
Usually he can see you
Well
Kid on a ladder knows
Patrolling an altitude
Oh no
Kid on a ladder knows
Nothing else matters though
Kids on a ladder
Are dizzy
Let them down
And place them in
Prison for older kids
Or just them scatter
Growing older
Maybe wish them luck
Searching for classifieds
For higher rides
And drones
Kid on a ladder rknows
Patrolling an altitude
Kid on a ladder rknows
Kid on a ladder rknows
Come on Mr. Christian
Hand me the jug
I won't take the boot
For a coward's salute
Not gonna weep now
Come on Mr. Christian
Hand me the plug
I've seen better heads
In animal beds
Let's go to sleep now
Better before however
Stereotypes kill time
And you're killing mine
Come on Mr. Christian
Pity the light
Say goodnight
Tomorrow I shape up
(Or ship out)
But they're on good germs
With the air
And decent quakers walked there
To land
In god's hands
Silently they sweat it out
With nervous beards
And cucumber guns
In a zone of behavior
On the edge of a mirror
In a pool of milk
Go the giants of truth
On their golden walkers
Their bar mirror teas
To snort
And dreamy dear milk ways
Quite broken
A grand array of mustards
Dribbling nectar
Through apple cores galore
Sinners and wonderers
Quite chosen
Illustration museum
Let us cry from a window
Paregoric sop
Heavy clods at hole one
Apollonian bronzefoil
Grain feeding their flames
Do tell
And puffing through clenched teeth
Flies open
They stand apart in clusters
Staking the future
With histrionic bore
Sinners and wonderers
Quite chosen
Hail hail baloot!
Bookworm fever
The happy galoot
It takes work
Fields in the moon
Breeding and lust
Superior in august
A gust
At ichabod wood
Is good
To keep it moving
The family trade
Games in the playhouse
No union is small
Inside a thick house
To hide from it all
But out in the sizes
Where soon it may be
Greater alive
The quickers arrive
Kind of the fence
And character prize
"We'l have none of that"
No quicker surprise
But out in the sizes
Where soon it may be
Greater alive
The quickers arrive
Came a blast
From the spores of creation
Driven off by twos
For elsewhere
The quickers arrive
The quickers arrive
The quickers arrive. .
Devouring frightful birds
Through quick windows
(Options on beef p. 5)
And then imagine a tomb
Of awkward selectors
For their women and children
Dispersed the pavements
Good fortunes at last
That quintessential spark
At hotel x
At hotel x
At hotel x
Where vicious daughters
A driven filthily
And anything hides
In shriveled artichokes
Clean on carpet floors
Arm escape
Without a kiss
Chairs fall loudly
Supplementing oboes
The trees outside
Are heavy with acorns
Naked swimmers faking sleep
New suits are worn
Nattily thus destroyed
At hotel x
I think a telescope
I think that nobody leaves
I think of how very old
I think I'll never be told
I think in time I will see
I think by clutching a note
I think I'll probably go
Climb an invisible tree
And then I'll know
My place at the table
I think of polygraph lines
I think of how very far
I think I forward a car
I think I know who you are
I think a shadow / a face
I think a wake up call
I think of everything now
Or think of nothing at all
I think I know
I think of where you are
Say this and level with me though
Make this alright and you will know
This is a load
You'd like to throw away
And go away
Today
Please be honest
You could come to a word
I should know
Shakespeare's honor
Take a plain english microphone
And broadcast
All you should know
Bet you wanted to test the waters
No?
I guess I wanted to know
If you'd be lying now
Please be honest
And confess to a make believer priest
I'm a believer
I'll find an answer
And this my puzzle box guarantees
Spectators advance
Personal strangers in your sleep
Unknown eyes
Newly approach and logical
Are you alive?
Well then
Come dance the painted three
Do to with glee
At nightmare jamboree
A limping desire
A thriller's wink
Painted lips on a sea shell
Hear it crying
Gazing at the harbor
Yeah, a crawling desire
It's the last stop
In billboard fascination
I won't know all the words
But I'll finish what I started
That's well ahead of time
Can we live without nets
In the empire of the bottle?
Shall we not sink
From the effort of the swamp?
No more shots in the arm
No more comebacks in the bottom
Rise to the top
Merely offering the plate
A louse on it's knees
Sees beneath trees
A louse on it's knees
Must therefore be praying
Duly warned
She had been gazing at a charmer
Eyes call to the snake
Fancy nails
And fattening
A dress
A street of swollen legs
Her pleasant crimson face
Is content
"Eye shop heaven"
The gaze falls on
Bargain slips
Do not now keep
The quick candy eyes
A dartboard display
If you look away
You are simply lying
It's slightly strange to say
Cleanly shaven
Out to blow
Money he did not have
Chips fall to a rake
Fleshly pale
Black and blue
Peddlers parking
No one begs
The pearly madhouse whites
At the gates
Of eyeshop heaven
Sized up for market price
Embezzling a snatch
The milk of red eyes
The catch of the day
If you look away
You are simply lying
It's slightly strange to say
You are simply lying. .
In the gloomy palace
Sad Baby Eyes
Sad Baby Eyes
In a holder only eyes
Doom and gloom on a second hand piano
Ohhh!
In the city of oil
The ozone never came
And just as unfortunate
The sweet spot bled out
To stain your life
Got you covered
First on the ice
Then on the fire
5 degrees on the inside
Baby that's cold
96 years and still crying
Baby that's old
In the roots
In the soil
To not move anywhere
Attempts to emancipate
With not much success
In this day and night
Much too frozen
Curse at the sky
For not getting higher...
40 year starter
You can do it
Uglier shoes
You can prove it
With Generox Gray
Complete the transition
On your most sensational day
Use political silence
When fighting cavities
Fill in some holes
For strength off the map
Try Generox Gray
The past present future
Take the oath
Today is the day
Nicely discovered
See them alive
See them alive!
Display your emotions of anger and fright
A birthplace to be and the best place to fight
But most of us have to be home by ten
Look out for truth when it's full of surprise
In need of assistance?
Try one of these guys
But most of all
Let us go home again
Don't run
Should I have a gun?
Or maybe a map
I might need a nap
No more demands
When we all hold hands
At the end of the world
Skeptical islands and ships they will pass
Too proud to cloud in a radiant glass
God save them all
I'd like to have them all
And fly
The full moon is high
The land sea and sky
It gets in my eye
And everyone stands
When we all hold hands
At the end of the world
I'm leaving
Don't interpret it wrong
And don't worry
I'm not leaving for long
Catatonic
Haven't packed much, just so you know
I'm complacent
And reluctant to go
Stick you in a carrier and
Take you to the shows
What you think is not work is work
The insiders know
That I miss you;
Come as you wish to...
We liken the sun to lightning
Perfect lightning
Time takes a lot
To Earth be lasting green
From birth to death
The wheel of hands
A lasting thing
We liken the glue and paint
To lightning saints
The boardwalk clowns
Saints and clowns
Burn your face
With your gun
Light your head
Liken the sun...
Simply massive
Seeds in jettison
Draw attention to the fever pitch
Total sockets
For blowing the torch
Overloaded in the fever pitch
And what do you know/say/care?
A broken down chain
Streaks across the highway
A broken down chain
Streaks across
The high speed cracking highway
In the sidecar
Bundled up locked out
Waiting for you
We took the long way home
And we didn't come back alive
See it in the mirror
In the screen
Decidedly gone absent
From the scene
Gonna fly down
Pick it up shake down
Get it to you
We took the long way home
And we didn't come back alive...
People are hard
Ask easier questions
The sparrow is cold
Packing the dead zone
They're not just shopping
It's more like head hopping
But we'll send them packing
The dead zone
Music in boxes
Nail heads
Hat companies
Well worn fools
A room full of dolls
Idol hands
Confident knives
Psychopath timecard
Philosophical zombies
Gymnasium rats
Negative twitters
Earth politicians and ozone sneakers
Packing the dead zone
Packing the dead zone
Packing the dead zone
The beds crawl away
Splashing the window
A fresh view
Primary flesh
Flesh primary
Calendar queen
Mother numerical
Doesn't believe
In throwing christmas cards away
Or anything moves
Perhaps the furniture
Where the homeless snooze
In ticket shirts
For year to year eternities
They wave goodbye
To careless gestures gone away
To what begins on new year's day
Stop telling me I don't know what I'm talking about
Can see it in your eyes, you know I'm not that tough
I may have created all that I am here
The situation has me I've gotta grab it
I don't know which way to fall
Feeling overloaded
You say I may be the cause
I don't know if I believe in me enough
Feeling overloaded now
Stop telling me I don't know what I'm talking about
I try to give and all I get is a feeling of regret
I don't know if I can be everything you want
I don't know which way to fall
Feeling overloaded
You say I may be the one to blame
I don't know which way to fall
I'm feeling overloaded...
I have tried to read every page now
But the wind just blew it away now
Yank bravely-happened to choose you
To keep you every night
But you keep me down
Why do you keep me down?
I'm trying to keep all of my strength now
But my knees just blew it
I found you insanely
Now I can't lose you
And I try to every night
But you keep me down
Why do you keep me down?
I'm driven to you
I'm driven to drink
God make it your heart
Your art
I reputiate thee
Thou venomous harpie
I'll plead every day now...
Hot on a trail
Asking cold questions
Would you like to know
How he came from Ohio?
He's the west coast company man
Unofficial value
Proudly #1
West coast company man
A plan
No artificial tan
Check out the western sky
Before you die
Hot on the trail...
He's a self-made company man...
Why are they screaming?
What did they win?
A bucket of gravy?
Hammers and nails?
Here's to them
Building a house
Maybe I'm in
Why am I screaming?
What did I win?
A happier face in stained glasses
Warm up to religion
Maybe I'm in
Warm up to religion
What can I win?
A happier face in stained glasses
The high five hall of famers
The high five hall of famers and their motionless screams waddle too close so that no one can see
The high five hall of famers have no where to be and ignore all the direction on purpose it seems
The high five hall of famers pull out of the rut and demand consultation on the spot
The high five hall of famers have no regrets exposing their uglies to the rest
The high five hall of famers got you screaming from your knees when your howlers are above the whole scene
We saw you in some heavy handed vision
We laughed inside the alien machines
You called us in to some sudden fiction
And danced inside the waving of the sea
Oh sudden fiction
Come on come on now
Come on come on and throw back
I want to rest my head inside a vision
No static mind could elevate to see
We saw you throwing shapes in the fountains
And selling off the sentiments for cheap
Oh sudden fiction...
Heavy the jaw...
Walk finch
A singular net
In most uncertain areas
How about you?
How about me?
Keep noble dreams alive
Keep Roman dreams alive
Be careful on the highway
How about you?
How about me?
Sky high headlights
Set the times
We're going out...
Facing the stars
And voices of angels
Nourishing words
To flesh and blood and bone
It's down to
The red team vs. the blue team
Scanning the bars
The choices of mortals
Indigenous jars
Will get you out of jams
It's up to
The old team vs. the new team
What must we do to survive?
The gods know the answer
Better than I
Like more persuasive snakes
It's food
From what I have seen
(what have you seen?)
A world full of people
Their bellies full of lies
Of mystery meats and pies
Of food
It's food
We can kill them
But we can't film them
We can can them
But we can't scan them
Scam them
10 billion Ringo fans
Can't be all wrong
Target your audience
Then write them a song
Cheap buttons
That say something simple
A catchier phrase
For popping a pimple
Elemental quickster
With mercury ink
Write something kitschy
Then make it sink
Like a good tattoo
Or permanent marker
Some like it less
Some like it darker
Cheap buttons...
Cheap buttons fall off your shirt...
10 billion Ringo fans
Can't be wrong
Substitute 11
Do you have what I ask
To control your class?
Are you up to the task?
I must now implore you
To use every wit
But the ten that came before you
Are no longer it
Can you settle them down?
This is all that I ask
Are you up to the task?
...in his never ending recurring
Nightmare, Substitute 11 is passed out
Head down on his desk, an empty
Whiskey bottle in his hand. The
Classroom is also empty as
Children are running out of the
Building in to the neighboring
Community - camera soaring to
Birds's eye view -
End credit song blaring
"Substitute 11, come in
Substitute 11, can you hear me?"
Mechanical brains are invading my head power
Shadows that pass breathing life in the night
I never can be what you want me to be now
The house plant is dying
I think it needs water
And if you could be anywhere in the world now
And if you could have any object desired
You'd be wired
And where were you going when you had it in my face
Forcing a door key that just won't fit in
And fixing the lock even though it's not broken
Knocking down the scenery
And planning an eatery
And if you could be anywhere in the world now
And if you could have any object desired
You'd grow tired
The see-hole
A witness by design
Is going to laugh about it
The 3 ring circus
The box office smashed
The killing off of characters
The finger prints on flower stems
Tickling for ivory
The wardrobe
As jury being hung
Is going to laugh about it
The 3-D glasses
In flight jackets bombed
Are spilling out in to the room
The doom day flowers horrified
Gathering black masses
Resting in the Mediterranean, yeah
Sending the tax man on the run, yeah
Displacing a city one by one, yeah
A techbot in a condo being scum, yeah
Deflect/project oh your actions are never circumspect
Defect, product once proud city now wrecked
Planned obsolescence is the goal, yeah
Putting the renters on the dole, yeah
Silicon valley takes it's toll, yeah
On backs of the million you control, yeah
Evil things have come to light
Tasting apples with parasites
Alright, alright
Tanning beds explode in front of us
Angry children begin to cuss
All in the same key
Sharpening elbows and kicking knees
Olives made with concrete pits
Sows scrape low hanging tits
Chuck Berry wasn't even on the list
Eyeliner runs on cherry lips
And as we abandon all those who defended us
We all know what is waiting for us
On the circus bus upon the circus bus
The yellow haired wizard won't be coming back
Swimming as slow as a wet paper bag
The crooked hat on the weird witch's head
Is filling with ideas to break our band...
Sentimental wars
We are all fighting
Can we ever find the time to be alone?
Do you ever want it all?
Do you ever find yourself?
Do you ever want to be all alone?
Can we ever find the time, just you and me, all alone?
Can we ever find a time, just you and me, all alone?
Just take my hand
I will walk with you
Out comes the sun
Whenever I'm with you
Just take my hand
I will be with you always
I've got this feeling inside of me...
He came to the river
Of razor blades
Noticed them boating
Happy men
From standard toil
Where mosquitos fly alive
And dive
On whole tomatoes
Happy men fishing
Precise razor blades
They're slicing up whole tomatoes
Spoiler mosquitos
From vast everglades
Are diving on whole tomatoes
Avoiding conditions
An excellent bypass
And crashing traditions
Submerged in their morass
And always the drinking card
And always a plan for the attack
Beware the lion roaring back
Upstream to the back slide
For giving it a swim
Diving for false light
The mirror is still him
And running the roses are in bloom
And throwing a chair across the room
For busting a hole to fly the womb
Amusement park is over
They'll exit holding hands
Amusement park is over
Tearfully
They'll meet in Summerland...
Risk the city
All of the steel
The agency called
They want my prints
The frozen lustre
The hidden games
The finger pocket
The king is talking
Behind the golden doors
He gets the air
It's ugly loud
Middle of the ear
Voices here
Behind the golden doors
Electric currents
Name the brains
That swim them all
But need more time
Behind the golden doors
It's cheap and somewhat vain
But you gotta read the label
And then you would know
And then you might have
The possible edge
The baby we have
And maybe we have
A chance
When it appears clearly
Clear on the wall
The possible edge
It's good
It's what they say
But you gotta see the angle
And then you might find
And then you may gain
What's well within reach
Or out of control
But maybe we'll search
The soul
When it appears clearly
Clear to us all
The possible edge
At going ahead
To get to the point
Start this baby up
A lost guy down in the world
Wants to break in
He'll tell you where to go
Grand destinies
New hot topics
The escape scene
Watching eternity
The people demand an answer
What are you waiting for?
It you can see me I'm too close
Pick it up now
Double your time
Watching eternity
The people demand an answer...
I'm just standing under
Taking cover
Fumbling zipper
Dragging the stripper
For a spin
Go for a win
On the second loveliest planet
Picking a window
Try it out - it's nothing
Have fun with that
It feels like nothing
Understanding
Wonder woman dares you
Switch on the strippers
Their golden slippers
Always fit
You fancy it
It's the same for all populations
Choose any nation
Try it out - it's nothing
Be done with that
It feels like nothing
Drawing like the wings on a wedding bell
The queen of the glass is afraid to blow you
You up in the air without a net below
But she'll try
And if only more bad luck
Will pass you by
Flying on a scandal
Decide your trip
You fall like a drip from a wedding gown
Come early in the world
But they're ready now
And your dream is a dust speck in your eye
Make a wish
Blow out the candle
Anything you might need
Birthday democrats can handle
Anything
Everything you love
Everything you love
Everything you love
They will give you
Everything you love
They will give you
Everything you love
